  ","Here’s presenting the first part of the Bhutan Series Episode in Paro. I went straight to Paro as first part of my road trip in the country. The drive from Phuntsholing took about 4 hours.  The entire budget of my Bhutan trip was close to  INR 25k. You can carry cash everywhere in Indian currency in Bhutan as it is accepted. Some things about Paro below:1. The place where I stayed at in Paro is called Ama’s Village Lodge. You can book the place here - https://www.booking.com/s/32_8/e9f2a7ab2.  The cost of entry to Taktsang Goempa is INR 500 and a round trip with any driver will cost INR 1000 from your lodge3. You can contact Mr. Yonten Norbu for driving you around Bhutan if you are visiting. His number is +975 17672515 , my experience with him was extremely nice. He was a perfect gentleman who ensured my safety and also made sure my experience in Bhutan was memorable. 4. If you are visiting Bhutan, I would highly advice you to get a local sim for contacting tour agencies or driver. A local sim will be available for INR 200 at Phuntsholing. 5. Other places that you can visit in Paro are - Paro Dzong and you can get a Hot Stone bath which is very popular in the areaLet me know in comments if you have any more questions.

    Vienna Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia
  ","https://www.expedia.com/Vienna.d17831...On your next trip to Austria, pay a visit to its capital city of Vienna. During the late 19th and early 20th century, this city became a cultural epicenter of Europe, contributing art, philosophy, and culture on its way to becoming one of the world’s great cities.During your Vienna sightseeing, you can drink coffee in the same cafes as Einstein and Freud, or wander down the streets that inspired Beethoven. Tour galleries devoted to some of the most magnificent artwork in all of Europe, then walk along the Ringstrasse. Also called “Ring Road,” this downtown boulevard home to private residences, palaces, and other exquisite examples of architecture for you to marvel at. Much of Vienna tourism is centered in its cafes. This is not just because its residents love strong coffee—though they do—but because Viennese social life largely grows out of its coffee houses. Locals will spend hours at their favorite cafes, reading the paper, speaking to friends, working on projects, or listening to music in the evenings. Sit at a table and watch the people of Vienna stroll by, or enjoy a sachertorte, or chocolate cake, while catching up on your latest novel. It’s impossible to visit this city and not be inspired.Vienna has long been called The City of Music. Find out why at the Vienna State Opera; a backstage tour will show you all the ins and outs of this majestic place, as well as give you a glimpse of why it has been at the forefront of entertainment since its construction in the 1800s. Afterward, head a few blocks south to the Volksgarten, or people’s garden. Stroll through its pathways and sniff the sweet fragrance of its hundreds of roses. What better way to end a day in one of the world’s most beautiful cities? What was your favorite part of Vienna?Visit our Vienna travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on social media:Twitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia Instagram: http://instagram.com/expediaPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/Google+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: http://viewfinder.expedia.com/",travel

    How to Start a Travel Blog [2019] Travel Blogging Full-Time
  ","Create a Travel Blog Website for Just $3.95 + http://bit.ly/lt-start-travel-blogLearn More Travel Cards + http://bit.ly/top-travel-cards-2019 _Click ""Show More"" to see Ad Disclosure_I've been a full-time blogger / travel vlogger for 9 years and transformed myself into a full-time travel blogger in the past 3 years. I will teach you how to create a website, build a brand and get you setup on the path to getting paid to travel. When I first started out in 2016, I didn't have a clue about how to take a decent photo and forget about shooting video. Today, I'm proud to say I'm halfway decent as a photographer and videographer and have racked up 800k followers on social and 1.5 million views on YouTube.// How Much Money Can You Make As a Travel Blogger?Since starting my travel influencer account, I've earned more than $200,000 from a combination of affiliate commission, paid sponsors, adsense and selling my own products. This is definitely a career that if you work hard and build yourself up, you can easily quit your job and live your dreams.// How to Make a Blog [2019] Focused on Travel BloggingMy advice for any new website is to use Wordpress. First of all, it's free, unlike SquareSpace which costs money to use and locks you into their hosting provider. With a Wordpress website, you can move it to any hosting provider (whether it be Bluehost or Hostgator when you first start out) or WPEngine when you really grow your blog and have a ton of traffic.// How to Start a Blog and Become a Full Time BloggerSetting up your first website should take no more than 15 minutes. Your steps are:Pick your domain nameSign up for your hosting planInstall WordpressInstall your themeStart bloggingSetup your blog here for just $3.95:++ http://bit.ly/create-a-travel-blog-we...// How to Write a Travel BlogThe really daunting task is shooting good photos and videos and telling stories as a travel blogger. I started out blogging not knowing a thing about how to shoot photos or videos but thanks to Youtube, I was able to teach myself everything I needed to learn. I suggest you do the same thing, start searching on YouTube and teach yourself.In this video, I walk you through exactly what my steps are to starting and making money with your own travel blog.I’ve tried almost every possible Monetization strategy and these are my proven methods that work for me:Affiliate marketing where you get paid a commission for selling somethingPaid advertisements like Crest paying me to review their white stripsAdsense revenue which I get from people watching this video and clicking on ads on my websiteFreelancing: taking photos, building websites or providing consulting to small businessesSelling a product: I have a style guide I created last year and it sells a couple of copies every month// my proven techniques as a full time travel blogger// find your speciality- Say you want to be a travel blogger, what’s one thing you’ll bring on every trip that everyone needs? A great bag. Imagine you took a different bag on every trip and reviewed it as part of the vlog. I guarantee you’d be one of the few experts reviewing just bags and you’d be able to corner the market. And when you do your videos, it would be really hard for someone like me or anyone else to copy your knowledge base and expertise- Besides travel bags you could also focus on bug spray, sunscreen, backup batteries, etc find something you’re interested in and own it// This will be hard, but follow these tips to ensure you succeedIf you need any help creating your website and starting your travel vlog, let me know in the comments, I reply to every single one.// FOLLOW US: IG: https://www.instagram.com/lifetailored/Wei's IG: https://www.instagram.com/threadtherapy/Couple's IG: https://www.instagram.com/meetthewises/Web: https://lifetailored.com/// Best Vlogging Kit for BeginnersBest Starter Vlogging Camera: Canon 60D: https://fave.co/2wpomKJBest Vlogging Lens: Canon 10-22mm 3.5: https://fave.co/2MDQ807High-End 4K Camera for Photo/Video: Canon 5D Mark IV: https://fave.co/2vaPUTvHigh-End Zoom Lens for Photo/Video/B-roll: Canon 24m-70mm 2.8 II: https://fave.co/2AyMHSDThe content in this video is accurate as of the posting date.

    Salzburg Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia
  ","https://www.expedia.com/Salzburg.d180...The Austrian city of Salzburg is situated on the northern edge of the Alps, close to the border of Germany. Surrounded by lakes and mountains, and straddling the banks of the Salzach River, few cities can match Salzburg’s fairytale setting. Few places can match its musical heritage either. Salzburg is the hometown of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and provided the settings for one of cinema’s most-adored musicals, The Sound Of Music.Take the funicular to Hohensalzburg, one of Europe’s best-preserved medieval fortresses. Down below in the Old Town you’ll find Salzburg Cathedral and the Salzburg Museum. Nearby, wander along narrow Getreidegasse, one of the loveliest shopping streets in the world.  Just off the Old Market Square, savor 300 years of coffee-making tradition at Café Tomaselli. For classical Austrian fare served with a side of Opera, take the short walk to Stiftskeller St. Peter. At the Müllner Bräu Brewery, hang out with beer devotees from all over the world.  Salzburg has long been a city where inspiration knows no bounds, especially when it comes to its palaces. Just a short stroll from the Marionette Theater, the grandeur of Mirabell Palace and Gardens awaits. While on Salzburg’s southern outskirts, explore the playful water features at Hellbrunn Palace. While Salzburg abounds with fountains, some of the city’s most impressive water features are its natural ones, such as Lake Wolfgang and Krimml Waterfall. For a waterfall with a difference, visit the spa town of Bad Gastein, whose falls roar straight through the heart of town. From the town, take the cable car to the summit of Stubnerkogel Mountain and walk Europe’s highest suspension bridge. The Salzburg region is full of surprises, so before heading back to the city, head underground, into the Hallein Salt Mine. From its salt mines to its symphonies, from its fountains to its waterfalls, Salzburg plays out like a living opera, filled with drama, comedy, intrigue and passion.",travel

    Buenos Aires Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia
  ","http://www.expedia.com/Buenos-Aires.d...Named for good sailing winds, Buenos Aires is the capital of Argentina, and home to nearly a quarter of the country’s two million residents. Come for the stunning European architecture, and stay for delicious cuts of meat, the city’s zest for soccer, and, of course, the tango. “The Paris of South America” boasts outstanding shopping and a friendly populace. A tour of Buenos Aires should cut through La Boca Harbor, where you’ll find numerous street vendors, restaurants, and street dancers willing to give you a spin. Wander down the streets to take in colorful artwork, and make a game out of asking the locals what neighborhood you should tour next. Here’s a hint: with so much to see, everyone will give you a different answer!Some will tell you to visit San Telmo for souvenirs, patio shopping, and crumbling historical buildings. Others will suggest Puerto Madero, a refurbished shipping port that boasts a mixture of old-world glamour and modern buildings. What everyone will suggest, however, is a stop by Plaza de Mayo. There you can take in the rosy architecture of the Casa Rosada, which was made famous by Argentine First Lady Eva Peron and the musical about her life, “Evita.” Take a tour and learn about her life, from her humble beginnings to her rise to power.Cap off your Buenos Aires sightseeing with an evening walk through Puerto Madero, where you can get a late dinner and dance until the next day arrives.What do you want to see in Buenos Aires?

  ","We only had one day to explore Luxor, Egypt, so even though we barely slept on the overnight train from Cairo, we went out at 7:00 A.M. to be the first and only tourists at the incredible Luxor Temple! It was totally worth it because it wasn't too hot yet and we took all the videos and photos we wanted with NO other people! Once the first tour bus arrived, we headed back to our hotel and had breakfast (AND COFFEE), but then decided to nap for few hours to wait out the mid day heat before heading to the Valley of the Kings via a $0.10 ferry and $7 taxi.

    Chicago for Kids and Families with Travel Blog Saucepan Kids
  ","Chicago for kids and families with travel blog Saucepan Kids. Debbie Woodward, Saucepan Kids Travel Blogger and United Airlines have teamed up to bring you this excellent family travel video. Showing you the best Chicago family activities, Chicago family restaurants and attractions. Enjoy Chicago with kids starting with your business class united airlines flight.https://www.united.com/ual/en/ie/http://saucepankids.com/https://www.choosechicago.com/- - Okay, kids in Chicago, we'll you've gotta make sure that you're in the center so that you can walk to all the great family-friendly attractions that are in the center of Chicago. I would say two that you really have to check out, if you're here in Chicago with your kids would be Wrigley Field, that baseball game. Never been to one before, it's so exciting the atmosphere is electric, the kids will love it. Also, I would say Navy Pier, that's iconic really and there's so much for kids to do, you'll be there for the day. Business class with United was amazing, it was such a treat, it was so luxurious and there was so much space. I was blown away by the comfort of the bed when it lay flat, I didn't think I'd sleep but I really did, and the Egyptian cotton bedding was gorgeous. The food was incredible and it just kept coming, there was so much of it and really good quality, not what you expect from airplane food, so that's fabulous. Well worth it. Definitely check out Lou Malnati's, which is the really famous Chicago deep dish pizza joint. A couple of locals recommended it, and I can see why. Great experience, great fun for the kids, really family friendly. And I would say, for a slightly quirky restaurant and still kid friendly is The Purple Pig. I really enjoyed that restaurant, there was a great menu available, surprising. The Dana Hotel, super modern, uber-cool and chic hotel right in the center of Chicago. We were able to walk to everything from the Dana Hotel, really comfortable. Great meal in there actually, we had a nice meal in there as well. And the rooms had everything, everything from gorgeous towels to yoga mats, to huge widescreen TV, coffee machine, everything you could need.",travel

Why?Quite literally, the atmosphere. Vancouver’s clean air is thanks to it’s really close connection to nature. There are mountains and forests surrounding the City, and the Pacific ocean is right on the cities doorstep. Here the great outdoors isn’t just a place, it’s a way of life. But it’s a modern City waiting to be discovered as well. So in this guide, we’re going to help you make the most of it! We’re going to look at food, money, transport, and a whole lot more, but first let’s get from the airport. Vancouver International airport is less than 10 miles from Downtown area, and is Canada's second busiest airport, after Toronto Pearson International.Getting between the airport and the City Centre is relatively straightforward – a 20-minute taxi ride will cost around $45. Another way into the City is the SkyTrain – it's a bit like London's DLR with driverless carriages, you take the Canada line for half an hour or so, and it costs around $7.Vancouver has an extensive public transport network, as well as being a really easy place to dive. Here’s what you need to know:Now it’s not often that we can tell someone to drive a car through a major City, but in Vancouver drive away until your heart's content! We hired a car and cannot recommend it enough. Thanks to the Cities grid system, wide roads with plenty of easy understood signs and generally well-tempered drivers - driving was an absolute doddle! There’s ample parking wherever you go, even at the busy tourist hotspots, not to mention fuel is cheap, and traffic generally wasn’t too bad in our experience.",travel

Shop at the same spice market locals have been visiting for generations, then visit the stores in the Gold Souk, a jewelry-centered traditional marketplace. For a more modern shopping experience, go to the Dubai Mall, home to over 1200 stores, an underwater zoo, and KidZania®, a “city” where children can roleplay various careers.To soak up some of the legendary Dubai sunshine, simply step outside. Take in the view of the city from the observation deck of the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. Continue your Dubai tour by wandering through the exotic buildings and resorts, or visit some of the public beaches. If you’d like to try something a little different and don’t mind paying a small fee, you can also attend local hotel beaches even if you aren’t staying there.You can’t finish your Dubai sightseeing without a trip into the desert itself. Ride a camel, go sandboarding, or just stand out on the dunes and marvel at the beauty of it all.

    Top Places in France: Alsace | Expedia Viewfinder Travel Blog
  ","Alsace is a famous region in north eastern France that’s been producing wine for centuries. Lauren LeBrun from the Expedia Viewfinder blog shows us why it’s one of the best areas in France for wine tasting and village hopping. The region stretches across 40,000 acres and more than 100 villages. Riquewihr is a town in central Alsace that dates back to medieval times. Being there makes you feel like you’ve traveled back in time! Walk down the cobblestone streets and you’ll see timber-framed, brightly-painted buildings. The architecture has been carefully preserved throughout the centuries, so it appears almost identical to how it looked in the 1500s. The town is packed with restaurants, shops, and wine tasting rooms. Here you’ll find local favorites such as tarte flambée, French crepes, and fragrant cheeses. But one of the main reasons why people visit Alsace is to wine taste. The region is known for its Riesling wines, which are actually drier than other Rieslings produced around the world. Go to any village on the Alsace wine route and you’ll be able to taste a variety of wines from family owned vineyards. If you love food, wine, and charming villages, then Alsace is the perfect place for you. Cheers to your next vacation in France!BLOG: https://viewfinder.expedia.com/TWITTER: https://twitter.com/ExpediaINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expedia/ PINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/expedia",travel

    A Day In The Life Of A Travel Blogger
  ","Join me at Big Berry in Slovenia as I show you what a day in the life of a travel blogger can look like. 'Can' is a crucial word - every day is different when you're a travel blogger. It's one of the things I love most about working as a travel blogger, but it does mean there's no 'typical' day. In this day in my life video, I'll show you what a day on a press trip look likes. Press trips are a common part of the travel blogger lifestyle, but just like the job itself, every press trip is different. This press trip is at a resort called Big Berry. It's on the Kolpa River in Slovenia and is a luxury resort for relaxation. That means this blogging trip was a lot more relaxed than usual! On this day, my main goal was to experience the resort and the Big Berry ethos, as well as making sure I had enough photos for the blog post I will be writing. In this vlog, I used the Canon M50, Canon 5D iii and DJI Mavic Air drone. Here's a full list of cameras and gear I use for blogging: https://www.alajode.com/blogging-vlog...As always, thanks for watching!

    How I make money while traveling the world (and eating)
  ","►How to Start a Travel Blog: https://migrationology.com/how-to-sta...►How to Make Money While Traveling: https://migrationology.com/how-to-mak...The number one question I get asked is how I can afford to travel, while making money, and blogging. I'm going to answer how I make money, and also how I can afford to travel and eat in this video. Also, I'll share how I think you can do it too!There are many many ways to make money while traveling, and I have friends that are working on cruise ships, blogging, affiliate marketing, freelance writing, and even skydiving, while earning money to be able to maintain a lifestyle traveling. But instead of sharing all the ways on how to make money traveling, I'll first share the ways I make money.First I want to say that all of these ways that I make money while traveling are all the result of initially starting a blog back in 2009 and committing to writing quality and useful information on it on a regular basis. If you want to make money while traveling, I'd highly recommend you start a blog on whatever you're passionate about and begin blogging high quality useful information to show your expertise, and also connecting with others. (If you're just starting a travel blog, Travel Blog Success is an excellent course that I recommend: https://travelblogsuccess.com/?ref=18 [affiliate])1. Affiliate recommendations - This basically means earning a small commission as a referral. There are many companies (places like Amazon and Agoda.com for hotels) that offer a commission if you refer someone to a purchase. As an example, on my website I give away a lot of free useful tips about visiting Bangkok (http://migrationology.com/bangkok-tha...). And I also recommend a few hotels which, some of which I've previously stayed at, and others which I've just visit and highly recommend. So if you were to click one of the links and book that hotel, I would get a small commission as a referral. I only recommend things that I use myself or trust.2. My premium travel and food guides - The biggest way I make money while traveling is by selling my premium travel and food guides (http://migrationology.com/travel-guides/). Right now I have the Bangkok 101 things to do guide, Eating Thai Food Guide, Vegetarian Thai Food Guide, and the Delhi travel guide, and I'm working on more. I prefer to sell my own guides than doing advertising on my website, because I can trust in the quality of my own guides.3. Freelance writing - As a result of first starting my travel blog back in 2009, I've had the opportunity to do numerous freelance writing projects, some big and some small. I've written for a few inflight magazines, as well as CNN Travel, and various other newspapers, magazines, and websites. I used to dislike writing, but the more I started blogging about thing I really enjoyed (like food) the more I enjoyed it. And after committing to it and blogging, I've been able to connect with so many others and had chances to write for many places. A blog is a great way for you to have a public profile of your expertise.4. Video, YouTube - Finally, the fourth way of how I make money while traveling and blogging is through videos. I made the decision to start making videos and I have committed to it. Ads on some of my videos is another chunk of my monthly income.Along with how to make money while traveling and blogging, it's also important to say how I can afford to travel? Most of the money my wife and I make now goes back into our traveling and eating. However, it's all about your priorities. We don't own a car and pay for gas, and instead we choose to buy plane tickets and eat street food. You have to set your own goals and priorities and live intentionally to pursue them.Mentioned in the video:My travel guides: http://migrationology.com/travel-guides/My travel resources: http://migrationology.com/travel-reso...Learn to make a succesful travel blog (especially recommended if you're starting out): https://travelblogsuccess.com/?ref=18 [affiliate]Getting a job on a cruise ship: https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?...

    🎥 Sri Lankan Fish Market - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Trincomalee Vlog Street Food - Trinco
  ","🎥 Trincomalee Fish Market - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog Street Food - Fish Markets Trinco - Trincomalee (Tamil: திருகோணமலை Tirukōṇamalai, Sinhalese: ත්‍රිකුණාමළය Trikuṇāmalaya) also known as Gokanna, is the administrative headquarters of the Trincomalee District and major resort port city of Eastern Province, Sri Lanka. Located on the east coast of the island overlooking the Trincomalee Harbour, 113 miles south of Jaffna and 69 miles north of Batticaloa, Trincomalee has been one of the main centres of Sri Lankan Tamil language speaking culture on the island for over two millennia. With a population of 99,135, the city is built on a peninsula of the same name, which divides its inner and outer harbours. People from Trincomalee are known as Trincomalians and the local authority is Trincomalee Urban Council. Trincomalee city is home to the famous Koneswaram temple alluded to in its historic Tamil name Thirukonamalai and is home to other historical monuments such as the Bhadrakali Amman Temple, Trincomalee, the Trincomalee Hindu Cultural Hall and, opened in 1897, the Trincomalee Hindu College. Trincomalee is also the site of the Trincomalee railway station and an ancient ferry service to Jaffna and the south side of the harbour at Muttur. The recorded history of Trincomalee spans more than two and a half thousand years, beginning with civilian settlement associated with the Koneswaram temple in the pre-modern era. One of the oldest cities in Asia, it has served as a major maritime seaport in the international trading history of the island with South East Asia. In the ancient world, it was successively the capital of eastern kingdoms of the Vanni country, developing under the Anuradhapura Kingdom, Pallava Dynasty, Chola Dynasty, Pandyan Dynasty, the Vannimai chieftaincies and the Jaffna kingdom through the Koneswaram shrine's revenue. Trincomalee's urbanization continued when made into a fortified port town following the Portuguese conquest of the Jaffna kingdom, changing hands between the Danish in 1620, the Dutch, the French following a battle of the American Revolutionary War and the British in 1795, being absorbed into the British Ceylon state in 1815. The city's architecture shows some of the best examples of interaction between native and European styles. Attacked by the Japanese as part of the Indian Ocean raid during World War II in 1942, the city and district were affected after Sri Lanka gained independence in 1948, when the political relationship between Tamil and Sinhalese people deteriorated, erupting into civil war. It is home to major naval and air force bases at the Trincomalee Garrison. The city also has the largest Dutch fort on the island. One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. http://www.howtocookgreatfood.com - https://plus.google.com/+howtocookgre... - http://www.howtocookgreatethiopian.com - http://www.howtocookgreatjamaican.com - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com - http://www.howtocookgreatfilipino.com - https://www.facebook.com/howtocookgre... - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com/",travel

    Travel Blog Sayulita Mexico - Exploring Hotels, Yoga and More Hidden Beaches
  ","Daily Travel Vlog #79 - It's a new day backpacking through Sayulita Mexico. We start by doing some urban exploring around and found the most amazing hotel called Villa Sayuilta. It's a perfect place to chill out, do some yoga, maybe attend a yoga or wellness retreat. The rooms are very afforadable and just plain awesome!! We then jumped on a mission to find the most amazing beaches hahah which involved alot of walking but when your exploring in other countries that is what it is all about!! We found our exotic paradise beach and then finished the day with some amazing Yoga in Hotelito Los Suenos. Normally we are backpacking southeast asia, but now we are going through mexico and found an awesome hidden gem called Sayulita. It's a small town in the province of Nayarit and is filled with positive vibes and amazing beaches. There are some beautiful hidden beaches around and all it takes is a bit of water and some wanderlust to venture down the coast and find that perfect gem. Today we took to the beach and went exploring. If I were to give any travel tips or hacks it would be to just get out there and go for it, most often what holds us back is the fear of the unknown. Running a travel blog has really made us step out of our comfort zone and put ourselves in unforgettable situations. Sayulita is a must visit if you are anywhere near it. (Just a short ride from Puerto Vallarta). We are always here to provide you with travel tips, tricks and hacks so feel free to reach out if you have any backpacking questions. So far vlogging in Mexico has been amazing and we totally recommend it.

So sitback and step into my daily life. Vlogging is totally new to me, but I hope to bring you on all my travels, adventures and all around exploring. A little bit about myself: I live in San Diego and love all things creative. I am a webmaster for work but do all sorts of things including design, photography and anything that involves using my hands or creativity.My wife and I are avid rock climbers and love go to on adventures in our 88 Vanagon.

    Singapore | Marina Mandarin Executive Club | Asia Luxury Travel Blog
  ","When it comes to Marina Mandarin Singapore by Meritus, you definitely can't judge a book by its cover.  The outside of the building is unassuming, leaving us insanely unprepared for the jaw-dropping awe you'll experience stepping through into the beating heart of this lovely property.  If you're lucky enough to arrive during the day, you'll be greeted by songbirds whose tunes echo throughout the hotel because all 21 floors open onto an immense atrium.  The staff are friendly and charmingly dressed, the rooms are large, and if you couldn't imagine staying in Singapore and not having the best view ... well, you're in luck because Club Rooms like mine come with a balcony and that iconic view of Marina Bay.Why You'll Love Marina Mandarin Singapore:-- Dim Sum Lunch at Peach Blossoms - the restaurant serves up some of the most diverse and inventive dim sum dishes that I've seen in Singapore.  There's a set all-inclusive menu and an à la carte menu with some really interesting extras like lobster and foie.  OHHH and my favourite part is that they serve bottles of Champagne and have a fab list of sakes and wines, which is not common at most dim sum lunch hotspots. -- The Views!  Come on, we all want that stunning skyline view of Singapore and Mandarin Orchard has the best view of Marina Bay Sands and the areas around it, including the ferris wheel.  Just wait 'til you see it at night.-- Meritus Club Lounge - I've been a huge fan of Meritus Club since I first stayed at Meritus Pelangi Beach Resort on Langkawi last year but Marina Mandarin really stands out.  They basically won my heart by serving Moët & Chandon champagne and some of the most interesting cheeses during the Club's happy hour!For TIPS, my full write up and review and 40+ pics, visit my travel blog: http://luxurybucketlist.com/destinati...XOXO ~ AngelaFollow the Journey:BLOGS: http://ExpatAngela.com  -&-  http://luxurybucketlist.comFACEBOOK: http://fb.me/AngelasExpatAdventuresINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expatangela",travel

    Vietnam Diaries # 8 Mystic Marble mountains Travel Blog
  ","Marble Mountains of Danang.Welcome to this episode of Vietnam diaries. We would take you to fascinating tour of Marble mountains.It stands as a bridge leading Vietnamese life from the present to the past. Marble mountains is so famous that it is visited by a lot of tourists.Whoever has visited the cluster would agree that, regardless of it being jam-packed with tourists, it greatly expresses part of  Vietnamese history and culture.The Marble Mountains are 8 kilometers South of Da Nang city.Blessed by nature, the Marble Mountains are wonderful to visit at any time of the year. The most beautiful season to experience these tropical coastal mountains is summer, however it is advisable to wear relaxed clothes as there are numerous stairs and a mountain trek to negotiate.The Marble Mountains are a cluster of five marble and limestone hills located in Da Nang. The Marble Mountains were not named by the Vietnamese, but by the French after studying the chemical element of the mountain’s soil. Accordingly, there are five separate mountains in the cluster, named after the five basic elements of life (according to Eastern philosophy): Kim Son (Mt. Metal), Moc Son (Mt. Plant), Thuy Son (Mt. Water), Hoa Son (Mt. Fire), and Tho Son (Mt. Soil).Named by King Minh Mang, the five mountains were once a favorite destination for noble classes. A Japanese school of Mahayana Buddhism emphasised the value of meditation and institution to set up sanctuaries in these mountains. Today, stepping on each rustic stone stair, listening to your heart beat, you could still feel the hundred-year-old statues whispering stories of the old days.Before being conquered by the Tran Dynasty in 1471, this mountain was a good shelter for the Cham. Today, in one part of Mt. Soil, you can still find traces of the Cham Temples.#vietnamtravel#msyticmarbelmountain#travelblog hoi an ho chi minh fusion 360",travel

    Vietnam Things to Do | Our Travel Blog with Tips
  ","Hi Friends,In this Vietnam travel blog, we're essentially showing you our experience with the top things to do in Vietnam. When visiting Vietnam, you should already be aware, based on any travel guides you've seen, that it's definitely not a typical Vietnam luxury vacation, but something more adventurous.Most of this video takes place in Ninh Binh, but at the end you'll see us kayaking near Hoi An, which is south of Danang.We had a ton of fun riding scooters around seeing all of the caves, temples, and pagodas. The mountains in North Vietnam are nice as well, because they aren't giant and you can climb them (or multiple of them) in a single day.Don't miss the river grottoes either, they are super cool, and you can see the set of the latest King Kong movie.Sneak peak at what's ahead: we visited Ha Long Bay, Angkor Wat, and are currently in Thailand - so plenty more of South East Asia is coming to the channel, stay tuned!- Jimmy and Maggie__CONNECTIG: https://www.instagram.com/bottom.line...FB: https://www.facebook.com/BLUFLifeBlog: https://www.bottomlineupfront.com/GEAR WE USEPanasonic GH5: http://amzn.to/2ztmO2FRode Mic: http://amzn.to/2Au6AGtDJI Mavic drone: http://amzn.to/2mao2gjZhiyun Crane 2: http://amzn.to/2maRHCJThese are affiliate links - so if you buy the stuff we use to make our videos with these links, we make a bit of extra pocket change so we can keep making videos and eating ice cream.#vietnam #adventure #adventuretravel #northvietnam",travel

    Penang | The Wembley Executive Club Room & Lounge | Asia Luxury Travel Blog
  ","I still smile when I think back on my stay with The Wembley, the shiny and new'ish St. Giles property located smack dab in the heart of downtown Penang.  In part because I met some really wonderful and amazing people there but also because of there was so much about my stay that felt very 5-star'ish that I was truly knocked off my socks.  Launched in the Spring of 2015, The Wembley has birds-eye views of the Andaman Sea, a very cool rooftop bar, and wonderful treats in their Executive Lounge.  If you're looking for either a helipad or affordable luxury that includes impressive Club level service then you've found the right hotel for you.  Why You'll Love The Wembley Penang:- Location, location, location!  You can't get anymore central and close to all the action than at The Wembley.- It has a helipad!  I'm a single engine pilot but I've also taken helicopter lessons and they won my heart with helipad.  Although, to be honest, I don't have the budget to be able to fly from my homebase of KL to Penang by private helo but ... we can dream, right?- The view!  What you'll see from the executive rooms, the Club, and especially the rooftop bar is an absolutely perfect vista on Penang.  It's the perfect backdrop for meals and fun or special moments.- It's affordable luxury!  While the prices are very low, the experience you'll have and the service level are at a very high standard.For tons of pics + a full write up and review, visit my blog: http://luxurybucketlist.com/malaysia/...XOXO ~ AngelaFollow the journey:BLOGS: http://ExpatAngela.com  -&-  http://luxurybucketlist.comFACEBOOK: http://fb.me/AngelasExpatAdventuresINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expatangela",travel

Their newly renovated rooms opened only a few months ago but I swear I felt like the first guest to stay in mine (it was utterly pristine) … and with attentive butler service, I rarely wanted to leave it. Foodies will love The Ritz because you’ll find something to tempt you day or night between their five diverse restaurants and lounges, with hands-down the best jellyfish in their fine dining Cantonese restaurant Li Yen that I’ve tried in my life.Why You’ll Love The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur:- The service! I’ve been reviewing 5-star hotels since 2011 and this is the first time I’ve listed ‘service’ as the #1 love but it’s true. It doesn’t matter where I go in the hotel, because I’ve been here a couple of times before (for afternoon tea and once for Sunday brunch) the staff not only knows what I like and brings it without asking but they all magically seem to greet me by name – I love that!- The 1-bedroom suites are bright and modern and so absolutely perfect you'll want to stay IN on this visit to KL.- The food!  Lordy, lordy the fooooood!  I ate so much, and so well, that I left with a couple extra kilos I'm sure.  Don't miss their afternoon tea (my #1 favourite of the big hotels so far in Kuala Lumpur) or the Menu Du Jour for dinner in The Library, it was my favourite meal of the weekend.- Champagne 'Sunday Roast' Brunch!  It's a grown up brunch, without donuts or waffle stations, and it's scrumptious.For 90+ pics and a full review, visit my blog Luxury Bucket List: http://luxurybucketlist.com/malaysia/...XOXO ~ AngelaFollow the journey:BLOGS: http://ExpatAngela.com  -&-  http://luxurybucketlist.comFACEBOOK: http://fb.me/AngelasExpatAdventuresINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expatangela",travel

    How To Find a Niche For Your Travel Blog or Instagram
  ","How To Find a Niche For Your Travel Blog or InstagramWhen you think of your job as a travel blogger, it's ultimately to provide value to your readers. It's normal human behavior to want to talk about lots of different topics, but in order to be a successful travel blogger or influencer, you need to consider perfecting your niche. Think of all the successful travel bloggers you love and look up to. Are they talking about tons of different topic, or really zoning in on a few in particular? 9/10 - they have travel as the umbrella, but are focusing on 2 or 3 sub niches (adventure, culinary, motivation)If you're using SEO tactics to drive traffic to your blog, you want to ensure that the person that comes to your blog for the first time, knows what to expect. If you have posts on motherhood, travel, fitness and fashion, you will most likely lose them as a loyal follower. While they may be interested in all these topics, they found your site via search, and are looking for more topics that cover this area. In today's video, I'll talk more about why getting niche will transform your travel blog or instagram, and tactics on how to get started!Relevant Blog Post: https://sidewalkerdaily.com/travel-bl...::::::Sidewalker Daily is committed to bridging the gap between travel brands and content creators by providing unparalleled support and educational resources on best industry practices.

  ","Although I normally opt for either a chilled Sentosa property or a hotel smack dab in the heart of Singapore, on a recent trip I had a hella-early morning flight, and trust me when I say I'm a night owl.  But thank goodness I did because it let me uncover this amazing jewel in Singapore, that is literally the closest 5 star hotel luxury property to Changi Airport with a sky bridge that connects guests to the departures terminal.  Crowne Plaza Changi Airport even has a brand new wing that is ulta chic and retrofitted for the business traveller, with tons of international charging bays for all of our equipment and devices.Why You'll Love Crowne Plaza Changi Airport:- The rooms are modern and cosy and come equipped with personal phones that allow guests to call 11 countries completely free of charge.- The hotel is connect to Changi Airport!

    Afternoon Tea at The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog
  ","I knew I was in trouble when I was told that afternoon tea at The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur featured 39 unique blends of teas – one of them only available at The Ritz in KL! Honestly, how does one decide which tea to sip when the selection is so beautifully mixed? Well, why sip just one when I could be naughty and try four? So I did. That, and indulge in an awe-inspiring selection of savoury and sweet treats that turned this High Tea into the highlight of my week!Why You’ll Love Afternoon Tea at The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur:- The food is to-die-for delicious. I don’t have a single complaint or even note from my visit, it was all perfect- A quartet in white tuxedo jackets plays the prettiest music you can imagine – from iconic 50s love songs to popular songs playing on the radio today. Think Breakfast At Tiffany’s meets Taylor Swift. They made the ambiance perfectly magical- Their exclusive tea blend is named ‘The Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur Blend’ and it is a mix of Chinese Tie Kuan Ying (tea served to royalty since the Tang dynasty) and green Oolong that is smooth and creamy, and smells of white flowers to me. I loved it!- They serve fruit infusions for those looking to avoid the caffeine kick- TIP for Vegetarians (or anyone with special dietary needs): You will LOVE their VIP service! Call 2 days prior to your visit and the chef will create a personalised afternoon tea menu just for youFor pricing and all the details, visit my travel blog: http://wp.me/p59XBQ-3dLXOXO ~ AngelaFollow the journey:BLOGS: http://ExpatAngela.com  -&-  http://luxurybucketlist.comFACEBOOK: http://fb.me/AngelasExpatAdventuresINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expatangela",travel

You can then show that you have rights to use the music should you receive a copyright claim or if you plan to monetize your channel. This is very important as it will prevent any possible strikes against your YouTube channel or videos.- Doesn't royalty-free music mean I can use it for free?*'Royalty-free' music is not the same as 'free music'. Unfortunately, this is a common misconception on the internet, and especially here on YouTube.Simply put, it means that royalties don't have to be paid to the creator each and every time it's used (ie. free of royalties); but instead, a one-time fixed fee is paid, which is via a license purchase. This gives you the rights to use the music and is also how I earn my living and feed my cat! :)- Do I have to buy a license for every video I make?No, you only need to purchase one 'regular' / standard license in order to use it in all your videos on YouTube, forever. If you wish to use another song, then you'll need to purchase another license for that song. - Can't I just give you credit in my videos, instead of buying a license?Unfortunately, no. Just giving credit to me in your videos doesn't protect you from copyright infringement in accordance to international law. A license is required to show YouTube that you have the proper rights to use my works on your videos, which is also needed if you looking to become a YouTube partner and monetize your videos.",travel

    How to Be a Travel Blogger — Creating Great Content

If you're a relatively new travel blogger or writer, then this course will help fill you up with inspiration and actionable tasks to fill up your editorial calendar. Learn more here: http://skl.sh/1Tt6sf9You don’t have to travel 365 days a year to be a travel blogger. Yup, seriously.There are plenty of travel bloggers who enjoy a job that keeps them in one city most of the year...they prefer living close to family members...they are sorting out finances before making a move...or they only have 2 weeks of vacation a year. (Sound familiar? Sign up for the entire course here: http://skl.sh/1Tt6sf9)Whether you aspire to one day travel every day of the year or you simply enjoy travel writing as a hobby, how can you successfully blog about travel when you’re not traveling? It’s a unique form of writer’s block to feel like you have no experiences or travel stories to write about simply because it’s been a little while since your last trip. But to be even remotely successful at travel blogging, you also have to be consistently publishing content. What’s a travel blogger to do?Well, I’m here to help you kick that writer’s block's ass and get content and posts queued up in your editorial calendar. By the end of this course, you will have a plethora of different types of posts to create and different brainstorming techniques so that you can write regular content for your blog, no matter how much you travel. You simply have to know how to dig up that content and use it in the best way possible.",travel

You don't have to restrict your holiday to just within the city, you can also take a day trip to Hakone from Tokyo via Train.Make your way to Odakyu and purchase your tickets from the Odakyu Sightseeing Service Center. The tickets would include whatever you need for the entire day. To get to Hakone, you would have to take the train and change to an uphill tram, before changing to the Hakone Tozan Cablecar which 1st stop would be at Mt Hakone.You would be able to take pictures with this active volcano, and also try their famous black eggs.  Once done, hop back onto the cable car which would take you past a few stops including one that gives you a great view of Mt Fuiji on a good day. Continue on the cablecar till the end to reach the cruise center, where you would board thie gigantic cruise ship which would take you across lake ashi. Take a short stroll and embrace the beauty of the beautiful sakura trees found along the river. A short 15mins walk and you would find yourself at Hakone shrine. Drink from their famous 9 headed dragon basin, visit the fertility tree and also take pictures at the huge tori gate by the lake.Travel Blog: https://livelaughtravel.net/Food Blog: https://livelaughtravel.net/singapore...FB: https://fb.com/livelaughtravelnet/IG: https://instagram.com/livelaughtravel...",travel

    Kollur Mookambika temple darshanam  ಕೊಲ್ಲೂರು ಮೂಕಾಂಬಿಕಾ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನ LIVE Karnataka travel blog
  ","The Kollur Mookambika Temple/ ಕೊಲ್ಲೂರು ಮೂಕಾಂಬಿಕಾ ದೇವಸ್ಥಾನ at Kollur, Udupi District in the state of Karnataka, India, is a Hindu temple dedicated to mother parvati Devi known as Mookambika Devi. Mookambika is Shakthi devi, the supreme mother goddess in Hinduism. She is worshipped in three different forms such as Maha Kali (goddess of power) in the morning, Maha Lakshmi (goddess of wealth) in the noon and Maha Saraswati (goddess of knowledge) in the evening. There are bus train services from Byndoor Udupi and Mangalore to Kollur at regular interval.Mythology holds that at the Kollur Mookambika Temple lived a demon named Kaumasura, who unleashed terror upon the gods by the special powers he obtained from Lord Brahma. While the gods were trying their best to stay away from him, good news came that the demon would face death. Learning of his impending doom, Kaumasura undertook severe penance. Lord Shiva appeared, asking the demon what boon he would like to be granted. Sensing that grave danger would come of the demon if his boon was granted, Saraswati, the goddess of speech took away his ability to speak. Kaumasura came to be known as Mookasura or the mute demon. Thereafter, the supreme mother parvati devi, the goddess of power, mobilized all the powers of the gods and killed the demon, and hence she came to be known as Mookambika. The place where Mookambika killed the demon came to be known as Marana Katte.The establishment of the Mookambika temple is attributed to the Supreme, Lord Parameshwara sadashiva, rather than to an individual person. Historically, the temple is estimated to be at least 1200 years old and is mentioned in conjunction with king Halugallu Veera Sangayya who installed an idol there.As a legend goes, Adi Shankara, the much revered spiritual leader from Kerala, once offered intense worship to Saraswati, the goddess of wisdom and learning. The goddess appeared before Shankara in response to his prayers. Shankara told her of his wish to have her come along with him to Kerala, where no temple was dedicated to her as yet. Goddess Saraswati agreed to go with him on the condition that Shankara must lead the way for her to follow, without doubting her and not looking back even once to check if she was with him. Should he break the condition, she would stop and stay right where she was at the time. Shankara agreed to the condition. So they started walking down the Kodachadri hills, with Shankara leading the way and goddess’ anklets tinkling and letting him know that she was with him. After walking some distance, the tinkling stopped all of a sudden. Shankara waited a few moments and stole a quick look backwards to find the goddess still with him, watching him with reproach. In keeping with the condition, the goddess stopped right there. Shankara, however, was not one to give up. He apologized profusely for breaking the condition and repeatedly begged and pleaded with the goddess to go with him to Kerala. Impressed by his determination, the goddess finally agreed to be present at the Chottanikkara Temple in Kerala in the mornings and return to the Mookambika temple by mid-day.",travel

    Travel Blog Sayulita Mexico - Good vibes, good times and beautiful hidden beaches
  ","Daily Travel Vlog #78 - Today is a new day backpacking through Sayulita. Normally we are backpacking southeast asia, but now we are going through mexico and found an awesome hidden gem called Sayulita. It's a small town in the province of Nayarit and is filled with positive vibes and amazing beaches. There are some beautiful hidden beaches around and all it takes is a bit of water and some wanderlust to venture down the coast and find that perfect gem. Today we took to the beach and went exploring. If I were to give any travel tips or hacks it would be to just get out there and go for it, most often what holds us back is the fear of the unknown. Running a travel blog has really made us step out of our comfort zone and put ourselves in unforgettable situations. Sayulita is a must visit if you are anywhere near it. (Just a short ride from Puerto Vallarta). We are always here to provide you with travel tips, tricks and hacks so feel free to reach out if you have any backpacking questions. So far vlogging in Mexico has been amazing and we totally recommend it. Thanks for watching and stay tuned for a new day and new adventure!!!Instagram:Martyn - http://www.instagram.com/saltycreaturesAstrid - https://www.instagram.com/livelovenat...Snapchat:Astrids is @castensaCoffee: https://www.sayulitalife.com/chocobananaSmoothies and Vegan food:https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restauran...Hotels:Airbnb - https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15875364CBX cross border express border crossing -https://www.crossborderxpress.comYoga:Villa Sayulita - http://www.villasayulita.com/the-hotel--------------------------Music by Joakim Karud - https://soundcloud.com/joakimkarud--------------------------How to Vlog? This is the question I asked myself as I started out the new year. I am always looking to be more creative and I decided that this year will be the year that I start a daily vlog. So sitback and step into my daily life. Vlogging is totally new to me, but I hope to bring you on all my travels, adventures and all around exploring. A little bit about myself: I live in San Diego and love all things creative. I am a webmaster for work but do all sorts of things including design, photography and anything that involves using my hands or creativity.My wife and I are avid rock climbers and love go to on adventures in our 88 Vanagon. We traveled to last year all around Mexico, China, Bali, Hawaii and throughout California and Neveda. I am hoping that 2016 will bring more excitement and more travels, so be sure to subscribe :)I use a Canon 70d combined with a Canon G7X for all my Vlogs.",travel

    Langkawi | Sunset Dinner Cruise with Naam Adventures | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog
  ","It's a pretty safe bet that I'm going to be signing up for anything that includes wine, a dinner cruise, and an absolutely memorable, picture-perfect sunset.  When I landed on Langkawi and started asking around at the Meritus Pelangi Beach for recommendations on the best cruise operator, the team there shared that they favour Naam and recommended their 3-hour evening dinner cruise on the Sea Falcon so I signed up to go a few days later.  Since I was just one person and staying at the jungle hotel Ambong Ambong (and not one of the main luxury properties they have scheduled pickups at), they provided very swish transfer service in a shiny black sedan that felt wonderfully VIP following days of vans and taxis.Ohhhh and it turns out I was the only non-Chinese guest aboard that night and I had a hoot and a half!  The wine was flowing, the food was actually really yummy, and the ambiance on the Sea Falcon was perfect.  A bit of a party at the beginning, and then we went into a chill-out vibe closer to sunset.NOTE: for the first time in over a year, I accidentally deleted the video footage I shot on my Nikon while transferring files.  So, what you'll see is still fun but it's sadly an 'Angela show' because it's what I shot from my iPhone.  I'm so sad, as I shot some amazing footage that night.  Anyway, do check it out, it's just missing the long shots and food and boat interior images.For more information, links to Naam, and some fun pics visit my travel blog: http://luxurybucketlist.com/malaysia/...XOXO ~ AngelaFollow the journey:BLOGS: http://ExpatAngela.com  -&-  http://luxurybucketlist.comFACEBOOK: http://fb.me/AngelasExpatAdventuresINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expatangela",travel

    🎥 Sri Lankan street food - Kottu Roti - Hoppers - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog Street Food
  ","🎥 Sri Lankan Cooking - Kottu & Hoppers - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog Street Food One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. On our last night before moving on we stopped at a Kottu Hoppers place, you can hear in the video of this the incredible noise that is made when making Kottu as the two large scrappers hit the hotplate and chop the roti with vegetables and spices. Well that was our time in this villa, amazing. So in the morning we take a 3 hour drive east to Kandy, see you when we arrive. Kottu is Roti or a type of flat bread chopped with a sauce of some kind added in the mix. The sound of kottu being made really is the background music of Sri Lanka. Cooks chop out on a hot flat griddle the roti and then add in pretty much whatever you can think of. Chicken curry, Vegetable curry and so on are popular. As the cooks hit the griddle with what looks like big scrappers, the sound of metal on metal fills the air. We pulled up outside a Kottu house and ordered from the car. Chicken and Cheese was our choice and it was brought over as we sat in the minivan. Plenty of fresh chilli and crispy chicken soon left my plate and i am now ready to go back to the hotel, feeling totally satisfied with my day. See you in the morning. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Savory hoppers are often accompanied by lunu miris, a mix of red onions and spices.Short eats are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils.Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. http://www.howtocookgreatfood.com - https://plus.google.com/+howtocookgre... - http://www.howtocookgreatethiopian.com - http://www.howtocookgreatjamaican.com - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com - http://www.howtocookgreatfilipino.com - https://www.facebook.com/howtocookgre... - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com/Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals.

    How to Become a Travel Blogger: The Good, the Bad & the Ugly
  ","How to Become a Travel Blogger - http://sassyzengirl.com/TravelBlogBecoming a professional travel blogger takes skills and a solid business attitude.  And - it takes time to get to the point of actually making some money, or a decent living of it.A number of skills must be mastered for Travel blogging:1) you need to become and excellent writer - and I mean: blogging style, which is very different from regular writing. Blogging is more like a conversation with a good friend over a cup of coffee than an article in the New York Times.Short paragraphs, easy on the eye, kolloquial phrases and an engaging style are keys to reach an audience in the internet world.There are numerous resources for good blog writing training that teach you how to become a travel blogger and the best one is a guest blogging course mentioned in this link, http://sassyzengirl.com/GuestBloggingGuest Blogging is also a great way to build a following which brings us to our second point of important skills to master as a professional travel blogger:2) Building a large following, both blog subscribers and very importantly on Social Media.Without a substantial following sponsors and travel boards will not be interested in collaboration with a Travel blogger, because there is no potential for them to market their products, hotels etc.http://sassyzengirl.com/TravelBloggin...This also includes mastering the art of ranking high in Google: SEOHo to become a Travel Blogger also includes an understanding of how to structure and article, how to perform keyword research, how to set up your travel blog etc - and you need to start from day 1 because Google ranking usually takes months to show any results, especially for a brand new travel site that still needs to build authority and credibility with google. SEO Video course:SEO 1 - https://youtu.be/U08NeWHApBUSEO 2 - kw - https://youtu.be/MmdlJi69S7ISEO 3 - OnPage - https://youtu.be/3hTvkkMXuycSEO 4 - OffPage - https://youtu.be/zpTumr0uy2Q 3) You must become a budget travel ninja - know how to travel for free, get paid to travel, get cheap air tickets etchttp://sassyzengirl.com/Budget-Travel...Most importantly, you need to understand that becoming a professional travel blogger means becoming an entrepreneur. You are building a business and a brand and that takes time, mastering new skills and iron determination.Most travel bloggers fail at monetizing their blog in any significant way, because they never bother to learn and master the skills necessary and they are not really serious or understand that a professional travel blog is a business - and not a hobby.As an example of a great - and immensely successful - travel blog check out http://theplanetd.com - one of the absolute top blogs in the world with hundreds of thousands of followers. It also includes a number of excellent post on how to become a travel blogger.But don't worry - they, too, didn't start big, they build their brand over many years and became experts and entrepreneurs and eventually reached these heights - and you can, too.More Digital Nomad Training Videos:Digital Nomad Jobs - https://youtu.be/3MS6Z9KKOMkKindle Publishing - https://youtu.be/k1UddId7Rw8Entrepreneur Bluprints - https://youtu.be/t0727M7iY4cBuild a blog in 10 min - https://youtu.be/iakdyz5RJDINew Bloggers: Start here - https://youtu.be/b9W-8_jy3fIhttp://facebook.com/SassyZenGirlhttp://twitter.com/SassyZenGirlhttp://pinterest.com/SassyZenGirlhttp://instagram.com/SassyZenGirltravelshttp://google.com/+SassyZenGirltravelshttps://plus.google.com/+SassyZenGirl - NEWhttp://www.linkedin.com/in/Luxury-SEOTravel Videos:Australia - Indian Pacific Train: https://youtu.be/QYoC5k9FYz8#howtobecomeatravelblogger#becometravelblogger#travelblogging#travelblogger#travelbloggingcourse#professionaltravelblogger",travel

    My Daily Life In NORTH KOREA (MYSTERIOUS 7 DAY TRIP)
  ","UPDATE - one year after visiting North Korea I traveled to South Korea and made a video comparing my experiences in both of these two countries. Watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJUSI... also, if you're thinking of traveling to North Korea yourself, watch this video to see why that might not be a good idea: https://youtu.be/8aiGVlGpVKA and think twice before making that decision.Learn how I started traveling full-time at 19: http://bit.ly/TravelingAt19Catch me and meet me during my travels: http://bit.ly/MeetWithJacobFree $34 AirBnb credit for your next trip: http://bit.ly/AirBnb34CouponI've always been very interested in North Korea because it seemed to be one of the most unique and mysterious countries in the whole world. This is my day to day life throughout the 7 days that I spent in North Korea. You can never be sure whether things were staged or not in North Korea because you are only shown what they want you to see. You can't choose where or when you will be going to specific places, they simply tell you to hop on a bus and ask you to get off at one point or another.That is why I didn't want to offer my opinion about whether things were staged or not, whether they were good or not, or honest or not. My goal was to show you what my day to day life looked like when I was there and let you make up your own mind and judge for yourself.Do not judge North Korea only from what you see in this video. This is what they showed us and there's a reason they show some things and not show the others. Also, knowing how much control they exercise over the population, everything could have been staged only for us.My favorite books about North Korea:Dear Leader by Jang Jin Sung - http://amzn.to/2vEkrrE;Escape From Camp 14 by Blaine Harden - http://amzn.to/2vEz6U1;Nothing To Envy by Barbara Demick - http://amzn.to/2vzieiI;1984 by George Orwell (I couldn't believe how similar some things in North Korea looked to the ones in the book) - http://amzn.to/2vE92s8.Videos about North Korea:10 Days in North Korea Documentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xs--...Escape From North Korea TED Talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdxPC...Subscribe!YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/JacobLaukaitisFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/JacobLaukaitisInstagram: https://instagram.com/jacoblaukaitis/Music:Prelude No. 2 and Prelude No. 5 by Chris Zabriskie is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution licence (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)

    Travel Hacking: Costa Rica Expat Problems (Travel Blog 11, San Jose)
  ","Starting my trip to Costa Rica and had a ridiculous incident with Costa Rican immigration via JetBlue. I was almost not allowed to leave the country and it cost me an extra $700 USD while I fought to get on the plane. In this travel hacking video blog I tell you how to get around booking a round trip ticket to Costa Rica to get your 90 day visa. Costa Rica has tightened their borders so expats do not overstay their visa and airplanes will not let you get on the plane without a return ticket. You can also book the Transnica Bus or TicaBus for very cheap to exit the country. Check out the problems JetBlue gave me almost causing to miss my flight, but I beat the system.

    Penang | The Edison Heritage Boutique Hotel  | Asia Luxury Travel Blog
  ","'Hell yeah' is pretty much the response you'll hear from me anytime I realise that the heritage hotels outnumber the large five star hotels in a city.  I absolutely adore them.  And The Edison joins the list of my favourite hotels in Penang because they have perfectly renovated their glorious property into a modern heritage hotel that respects its historic architecture yet embraces today's trends in comfort and style.Why You'll Love The Edison- The Edison is chic, charming, and classy.  It is bright and welcoming during the day, and romantic and assuring at night.It sits in the heart of downtown Georgetown, located next to two of my all-time favourite spots in town: Red Garden -- a local street food pavilion with live music nightly -- and the lovely Spanish tapas and wine bar Georgetown Wines- The Lounge is open 24 hours and serves up complimentary snacks and refreshments just like a VIP Executive Club.

    24 Hours in MADRID. Madrid Travel Blog
  ","We spend just 24 hours exploring the beautiful city of Madrid, Spain! We start off in one of the main squares of the city and eventually make our way to the Royal Palace of Madrid and the Sabatini Gardens. Later we take a run through Parque Del Oeste and find the Temple de Debod. As the capital city, a cosmopolitan city, a business center, seat of government, Spanish Parliament, and residence of the Spanish monarch, Madrid is also the political centre of Spain. Madrid is characterized by intense cultural and artistic activity and a very lively nightlife.---------------SUBSCRIBE! - http://bit.ly/1M4etCO---------------Madrid, SpainAccording to legend the original name of the city was ""Ursaria"" (""land of bears"" in Latin), due to the high number of these animals that were found in the adjacent forests, which, together with the arbutus (""madroño"" in Spanish), have been the emblem (The Bear and the Strawberry Tree) of the city from the Middle AgesPaseo del ArteIn English, the Art walk, is a place for beauty and art like no other in Europe. In only 1 kilometre, you will come across one of the most important museums in the world; Prado Museum, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum and the Reina Sofia Museum.  Beside this, you will find gardens, historic streets, science centres and libraries. If you don’t have enough time, try to go there! You will experience the best Madrid can offer. TOP 5 in Madrid:Puerta del SolPuerta del Sol is one of Madrid’s most visited squares. The square is surrounded by many small and historical streets such as Calle Arena and others. Puerta del Sol is a great place to start a walk around the most traditional places in Madrid. Cibeles FountainBuilt in 1782, it has become a symbol of the capital. The fountain is built around the Roman goddess Cybele; symbol of the earth, agriculture and fertility. The goddess is depicted being carried by golden lions. Definitely a great palace to visit. Plaza MayorThis square is part of the old part of the city. Plaza Mayor demonstrate the old architecture in Madrid; narrow streets, alleys and passageways, which were once used by swashbuckling swordsmen and medieval rogues.  Plaza Mayor is also well known to be the place for the best open restaurants and bars around this beautiful part of Madrid. Royal PalaceThe largest palace in Europe, this place was home to the majority of the kings of Spain; from Charles III to Alfonso XIII. Nowadays, although the royal family does not longer live there, it is still used during important visits. The best thing about the royals palace; you can visit it yourself. A great way to admire the best of European architecture.

    🎥 Sri Lankan Cooking - Pol Sambol - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog - Coconut Sambol
  ","One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Kool is a seafood broth from Jaffna containing crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns, and crayfish. It also contains long beans, jak seeds, manioc, spinach, and tamarind. The dish is thickened with palmyra root flour. ""Short eats"" are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils. http://www.howtocookgreatfood.com - https://plus.google.com/+howtocookgre... - http://www.howtocookgreatethiopian.com - http://www.howtocookgreatjamaican.com - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com - http://www.howtocookgreatfilipino.com - https://www.facebook.com/howtocookgre... - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com/",travel

Located on the coast of the South China Sea at the mouth of the Han River, it is one of Vietnam's most important port cities. As one of the country's five direct-controlled municipalities, it is under the direct administration of the central government.Da Nang is the commercial and educational centre of Central Vietnam, as well as being the largest city in the region. In addition to its well-sheltered, easily accessible port, Da Nang's location on the path of National Route 1A and the North–South Railway makes it a hub for transportation. It is located within 100 km (62 mi) of several UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Imperial City of Hue, the Old Town of Hoi An, and the My Son ruins. The city was previously known as Cửa Hàn during early Đại Việt settlement, and as Tourane (or Turon) during French colonial rule. Before 1997, the city was part of Quang Nam-Da Nang Province.On 1 January 1997, Da Nang was separated from Quảng Nam Province to become one of four independent (centrally controlled) municipalities in Vietnam.

    Family Travel Blog-Three Deaf Backpackers- My Heroes, Siem Reap, Cambodia
  ","http://www.thenomadicfamily.comSo, slowly, slowly; we're unraveling a life together, you and I. I talk a lot, and you've become one hell of a great listener. I appreciate that. Anna (the younger one) in Peru spoke of her father's favorite poem. Something about how every man has his first kiss and his first snowfall, and it stuck to me, really snugly. And like you, I have mine. I have my stories that make me who I am, that create the fibers that define where I've been, that push me passed the pain to create who I want to be.But, according to Buddhism, that 'me' is but only an allusion. Sakkaya-ditthi, personality belief, and it's what we hold onto, to help us define ourselves, label us, categorize and witness our own journey. But, Buddhism teaches that this false sense of self creates boundaries to spirituality and barriers to the true oneness with the world. It's 'me' 'my story' 'my pain' 'my life' and 'you'; likewise, I can stay flapping around lost in the winds of my own self, the way I was, who I was, who I am, who I will be- all false identities I use to mask my true, true non-self, anatta.Of course, remember there's Gabi the traveler who is spiritual, and Gabi and spiritual who is traveling. I get confused. And, here too, ever so slowly, I'm learning how to differentiate them and know which articles to put here on thenomadicfamily and which ones at gabiklaf. So, if you'd like to learn more about spirituality, finding that peace and inner light, anatta (non-self) and ways to find her- go there to gabiklaf. :-) And our tale continues....So, I have a story. And this blog allows me to share that with you, unraveling meticulously, one glorious string at a time, all the fibers that make me me. So, this is part of my story, my life-long fascination has always been deaf people. I fall in love with them, like I fall in love with people who work in book stores (Sheryl), librarians, Momma and Poppa old-fashion stores (especially with art and writing supplies), and firemen (but that's a whole different like of love, we don't have to get into right now). My entire life, I see someone signing and I'm stuck standing there, a bit too closely, with my jaw dropped and fairy dust parading before my eyes. A deaf person signing is the mute piped piper swaying his hands to the beat of the tune only her hears. He and me. So, it all starts like this. Kobi's sitting in the lobby of our hostel here in Siem Reap, Cambodia. He hands me a note (that I still carry in my notebook and look at every few days). It reads: ""I saw your site, loved it. My friends and I admire you guys for what you all are doing. Keep up with the blog and continue to travel the world! ""The note comes from Tandy Lewis, Shayna Unger, and Danielle Berrigan. Hand to heart, I look up. Kobi says, ""They're right over there,"" and I was lost in their music from that moment forth. Forget their kind ways, their shining faces and good looks, their interest in their fellow man, their ability to come right out and say kind things to encourage others; THEY ARE DEAF! That's it, deaf, deaf, deaf, and backpacking. OMG did my kids see mommy go into this strange metamorphosis. Years before we had kids and during a summer when (I can't recall exactly why) but I don't think I was working on the ice cream trucks; I enrolled in American Sign Language 101. It was an intensive 4-hour a day summer course. Walk in, day one, teacher is deaf. Here we go. So, sitting in the lobby in the middle of Cambodia, signing. I touched things that were precious and lost to me. A language I once knew, rather well. A language we had taught our three babies so that they could effectively communicate their needs before their mouth muscles knew how to voice words. We did baby sign in our home for years. And, remarkably fast, it came back. I was standing there talking to these amazing ladies, but not really, really there. I was somewhere else that I'd known long ago, but still can't define. I was in that silent world that somehow lights a voice in my soul that reveals a joy I do not know otherwise. It's a weird magic, and one I am grateful for the girls for bringing out again.Now, Murphy would have it that during the absolutely most endearing (this one or debate ably the 'Angel Outside of Consumerist Hell') interview for me personally, the camera would shut off. So, you only see two minutes of six... Maybe that's meant to show me that my Sakkaya-ditthi, personality belief, is an allusion, just like my actually recording of this kick-ass, unreal interview was too. Enjoy it, and it's brevity. I did.

    #1 Reason Your Travel Blog Will Fail (& ways to prevent it!)
  ","#1 Reason Your Travel Blog Will Fail (& ways to prevent it!)It feels like everyone now a days is interested in being in a travel blogger. Around the New Year, people get so excited and set all these goals for themselves. They think of a clever blog name, buy their domain, set up their wordpress and all that jazz,. After a few month, the excitement starts to fizzle, you're not as enthusiastic anymore. You're not seeing traffic to your site, or engagement, and then start wondering if you made a big mistake. You may start writing less and less, and just give up on it all together.Let me ask you this. If you opened a restaurant or a brick and mortar shop, do you think you'd become profitable after a couple of months? You would have to have money saved up to pay ""rent"" because after all, it takes spending money to make money right?

We made time for major attractions like Il Duomo, Sforza Castle, and Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, but we also veered away from the crowds in search of street art and interesting neighborhoods. This being Italy, we also tried to prioritize meals, sampling everything from pizza to risotto, and cappuccinos to aperitivos. The following travel guide will highlight 20 things to do when you visit Milan, Italy1) Milan Catherdral (Il Duomo - Duomo di Milano - Domm de Milan)2) Il Duomo Terrace 3) Italian Breakfast - Cappuccino and sweet Italian pastries4) Sforza Castle - Castello Sforzesco5) The Galleria - Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II 6) Risotto alla Milanese - Milan style risotto7) Street Art around Porta Ticinese 8) Colonne di San Lorenzo - Columns of San Lorenzo Roman Ruins9) Boat tour down the canal (linea traghetti gaggiano milano)10) Dine along the canal in Milan's Navigli District11) Aperitivo drinks and buffet - Apéritifs and digestifs12) Shopping in Milan down Via Torino 13) Visiting Chinatown for some Chinese food14) Ride a bicycle in Milan like a local15) Pizza al taglio (pizza al trancio) Italian pizza by the slice16) Basilica of Sant'Eustorgio containing relics of the 3 Magi17) Duomo Museum covering the cathedrals history in-depth18) New City Views with a hop-on-hop-off bus pass19) Museum of Natural History - Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano20) Night views of Milan nearby Il Duomohttp://nomadicsamuel.com/photo-essays...Our trip to Milan, Lombardy was part of the Blogville project where we stayed in a local apartment and experienced all of the best cultural activities, museums, restaurants, arts and entertainment the city has to offer. This city guide is our best attempt to create a mix of best attractions and off-the-beaten-path activities that you won't necessarily find in a typical Milan tourism brochure.20 Things to do in Milan Italy Travel Guide Video Transcript:Our first stop was Il Duomo, which is the most recognized attraction in the city. The cathedral took nearly six centuries to complete.So we've sat down at a little cafe and we're going to have our first Italian breakfast with cappuccino and sweet pastries.Something that surprised us about Milan is that there is a castle right in the middle of the city. Sforza Castle was built in the 15th century by the Duke of Milan, and it then underwent several restorations and expansions in the following centuries. Today it houses several of the city's most prized art possessions, including frescoes by Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo's very last sculpture.For some upscale designer shopping, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II is the place to be.So we just found a local little restaurant and we're going to be trying a traditional dish that is very popular in this city and in the Lombardy region. We are going to have Risotto alla Milanese.The Colonne di San Lorenzo are the remains of Roman ruins that date back to the 2nd century. They are believed to have been part of a bath house.Another fun activity to try in Milan is a boat tour of the canals. The city's canals are attributed to Leonardo Da Vinci, who in 1482 was called over by the Duke of Milan to help renovate the city’s canal system.Milan's Navigli District is one of the liveliest parts of town especially when the sun goes down for dining al fresco. So we've gone out for our first Italian Aperitivo. Which is kind of like a pre-dinner drinking tradition. Basically, you get yourself a cocktail for about 10 Euros and that gives you access to this massive buffet.And that's all for our visit to Milan. We hope this video will give you some cool ideas of sights and attractions to check out.This is part of our Travel in Italy series showcasing Italian culture, Italian arts, Italian foods & Italian cuisine.

    How to Ride the London Tube | Expedia Viewfinder Travel Blog
  ","Kate Thomas from the Expedia Viewfinder travel blog shares the basics for getting around London on The Tube. The London Underground is a masterpiece made up of 12 lines that stop at 270 stations in 6 zones. Most tourists will probably stick to Zones 1 and 2, so pay for your tickets accordingly. 3 Ways to Pay for Tube Fare:1. Travel Card - This is a disposal paper ticket that can be valid for a day, a week or even more. 2. Oyster Card - This is a plastic prepaid card that you can put money on and pay as you go. It costs £5, so don't forget to return it when your trip is over. You'll get back the £5 and any remaining balance. 3. Contactless Credit Card - If you have one of these cards, you can use it at the security barriers to tap your way in.

    Langkawi | Casa Del Mar 5 Star Beach Hotel | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog
  ","From the moment I caught sight of the charming architecture, the bold colours contrasting the blue sky, and my personal garden, I couldn't tell if I was Italy or Spain but somehow I was instantly transported back to the Med.  Then I turned around and my heart knew I was on the UNESCO World Geopark site of Langkawi, at the lovely Casa Del Mar.  This quaint five star hotel is home to just 34 rooms, making our stay an intimate affair where the staff remembers our usual order, knows our likes and dislikes, and instantly acts like we're part of the family.  In fact, this luxury property exudes such a chilled and relaxed vibe that I didn't fuss over how I looked once and simply relaxed throughout my entire stay.Set on the pristine Pantai Cenang beach, Casa Del Mar Langkawi is just a quick 10 minute drive from the airport and with lots of shopping and dining all around.  The cosy feeling of check-in on overstuffed sofas begins the chilled experience you'll feel throughout your stay.They have fun surprises like shelves upon shelves of books organised by language and a huge DVD library that you can simply walk up to and select what you'd like, which I did a couple of times and loved.For tons of pics and FULL REVIEW, visit my blog: http://luxurybucketlist.com/malaysia/...XOXO ~ AngelaFollow the journey:BLOGS: http://angela-carson.com  -&-  http://luxurybucketlist.comFACEBOOK: http://fb.me/AngelasExpatAdventuresINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/expatangela",travel

    Day Trip to Maastricht - Vlog (Video Blog) Travel Netherlands 🇳🇱
  ","A day trip to Maastricht, we walked across the Sint-Servaas bridge overlooking the Meuse River to both Our Beloved Lady Square (Onze Lieve Vrouweplein) and Het Vrijthof.

    Langkawi | SkyBridge & Glass Bottom CableCar | Malaysia Luxury Travel Blog
  ","Glass bottomed cable cars, panoramic views, and a terrifying glass window you can stand on hundreds of feet above ground ... well, those are just three reasons that the Langkawi SkyBridge and SkyCar experience is definitely the biggest and best 'must do and see' activity on Langkawi.  Opened in February 2005, the main boarding station for the gondola-style cable cars is located at the foothills of the picturesque Machincang mountain, said to be on a part of Southeast Asia that is the most ancient and the first to have emerged from the sea.The SkyBridge is the longest 'free span' and curved bridge in the world and it's exciting just to be standing on it!  I had a challenging but fabulous time as you'll see from the video :-)3 Tips for the Best Langkawi SkyBridge and SkyCab Experience:1 - Ride in the glass bottomed cable car!  Although the VIP gondolas are pretty cool with music, food & drinks, and only 3 comfy seats per car, I prefer the 95 Ringgit glass bottom SkyCabs for their roomy feel and amazing views.  Don't even consider the normal SkyCab, trust me on this one.2 - Opt for the SkyGlide!  To go from the top station to the SkyBridge in just a few seconds, riding on the SkyGlide is a breeze and only an extra 10 Ringgits.  Otherwise you have 12 minutes of stairs up and back.3 - Take off your shoes!  As you walk along Langkawi's SkyBridge you'll notice that a few of the floor panels are made of glass, giving you a birds-eye view of the canyon below.  For some reason, the feeling of standing on that was one of the scariest things I've done in AGES!  It's truly spine chilling but absolutely worth it.  It's one of my favourite memories of the SkyBridge for some reason.

    Travel blog Amsterdam Day 2
  ","Travel blog Amsterday Day 2This time we spent some days in Amsterdam with my sister and my brother. After our arrival by plane we drove first in our hotel. Our accommodation was located in the De Pijp district, which is part of Amsterdam Oud-Zuid and south of the city. De Pijp is a multicultural district and is shaped by many young people, which gives the area its own charm. In the district there are the Sarphatipark, a beautiful green area and the large Albert Cuypmarkt with about 100 stalls. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants as you can see in my Travel blog Amsterdam Day 2 Video in the area, so you do not have to be in the center of Amsterdam just to be in the crowd and experience the hustle and bustle of the city. It is not far from the major sights from here. Of course there was much more to discover outside of our neighborhood, but by no means on foot. Surely you know the cliché of countless photos and videos: Amsterdam and bicycles. In the ""city of bicycles"" you can see as many bikes as in almost no other city and it is not for nothing that there are more bicycles than cars. Amsterdam is very cyclist-friendly for a big city.I do not need to tell you that the city is very flat and cycling is therefore very pleasant. In addition, there are many bike paths and ways to turn off your bike. Much has been done lately to improve cycle paths and prevent theft of bicycles, showing how important the city is to cyclists. The paths are also very clean and even. Of course, we also cycled in Amsterdam on the bike and you should do in any case. Bicycles can be borrowed almost everywhere in the city and have to pay for 24 hours about 5 euros to 10 euros. Most bicycles are very simple and have only a few corridors, but you do not need them in Amsterdam either. Many providers also lend bicycles without an advertising sign that identifies you immediately as a tourist.So you can drive unobtrusively through the streets and feel like a native. One has to get used to the rhythm of the cyclists, because most of them are traveling very fast and pass pedestrians in slalom. But we had a lot of fun and we were able to move much faster than by public transport or the car. If I come to Amsterdam again, I will definitely rent a bike again. The first attraction to which we cycled was the Anne Frank House, one of the highlights in Amsterdam. However, we had the fear that this might not turn out to be anything, and so it was: we had no tickets and had to wait much too long. So you should take care of tickets in advance if you want to visit the Anne Frank House. Later, we met up with Luisa from the DIY blog paper and a few other friends who came from Rotterdam to eat. We were in the restaurant ""The Avocado Show"" in our neighborhood De Pijp. This is not just a name, but a full program: all the dishes at the restaurant include avocados. That does not sound like a lot of diversity, but we've just been proven the opposite. Of course you have to be a fan of avocados, because you can not ignore it. From breakfast over salads to main courses there is everything. The dishes are nice and with love prepared and we liked it anyway. The prices are like I think but a bit overpriced. In addition, ""The Avocado Show"" is currently incredibly popular and accordingly strong can be the rush. It was the same with us and we had to wait almost an hour to get a table. If the concept has made you curious, a visit certainly does not hurt eating out ""The Avocado Show"" is not a must. After the meal we let the day end comfortably on the canals, because the weather was still very pleasant. You will learn more about the canals in my other Travel blog Amsterdam Videos on my channel.I hope you like my Travel blog Amsterdam Day 2 Vlog.Thank you for watching guys!

    Toronto Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia
  ","http://www.expedia.com/Toronto.d17831...Welcome to Toronto, the largest city in Canada and a hub of trade and culture.“The City That Works” is full of a can-do spirit that is reflected in its buildings. From the famous CN Tower to the castle-like Casa Loma, there’s all sorts of eye candy for the architecture enthusiast. Your Toronto tour should include a trip to Edward Gardens in Hyde Park, or one of the many other green spaces located in the city. Take a bike ride along the trails, or enjoy a picnic while the local chipmunks look on. Don’t drop anything; they’ll grab it.Your Toronto sightseeing can continue at the Harborfront Center. Go for a walk along the marina, or grab a pint at a brewhouse. And no trip to Toronto is complete without a visit to the Hockey Hall of Fame, so make sure you’ve got your team paraphernalia in order before you venture inside. Looking for shopping? You’ll find the Underground City and Kensington Market ready to welcome you and your credit card – or several credit cards, as the case may be. After a day of madcap purchasing, why not stock up on fresh, healthy food at the St. Lawrence Market? You’ll have worked up quite an appetite for delicious local produce. Before you leave, head to Niagara Falls and take in the spectacle of nature’s power. You’ll never forget the sight and sound of all that water pouring over the falls, nor will you ever forget your trip to Toronto.

    Why You Should Visit a European Market | Expedia Viewfinder Travel Blog
  ","European markets are one of the best ways to experience the local culture and food. Lauren LeBrun from the Expedia Viewfinder blog takes us through the breakfast market in Warsaw, Poland to give us a taste of what markets are like in Europe. In Warsaw, tons of vendors sell all sorts of different dishes at the breakfast market. Walk around the stalls and you will find fresh produce, homemade products like cheese, and plenty of treats. One of the desserts you can find is the traditional Polish dessert called racuchy. It’s similar to an apple pancake. The dish is made by rolling apple slices in flour, dipping them in a thick batter, and frying them in oil to make them nice and crispy. It’s absolutely delicious! Stop by the Vegushka stall for the best racuchy.

    Jubril Agoro ""How I Really Make Money ""  Travel Blogging ?
  ","People keep asking me this:""Jubril, how do you make money and still travel the world?""I haven't actually broke this down in a video before like I'm about to here so watch the video to learn exactly how I make money all while traveling the world at the SAME TIME...Plus I'm having a free webinar where I outline exactly how I do it:And you are invited, you can register for free belowhttp://mrthinkoutsidethebox.com/Also, some things have really changed.....and I want to update you on what is actually working right now so you can avoid the common mistakes most people make that wastes so much time and money...The number one way I make money is:#1 running Facebook Ads for myself as well as a handful of other business owners and marketers by doing exactly this:I come up with the marketing material, write the ads, then run the ad campaigns for them.This is by far the most profitable and believe me, most people think Facebook ads are difficult to get working...But they're not...You just have to know how to write them.A perfect example is my client Tiffany......she is in the ultra-competitive finance industry.Where companies usually pay $20+ PER Lead in most cases.*I generate her leads on Facebook for 40 cents or less*[We've generated tens of thousands at this small cost]My secret?Matching the right audiences together and HOW we create the ads... [which it seems NOBODY does like I do]But there’s more...#2 Travel blogging - some cool side income but the real benefit is the awesome perks like free hotel stays, free travel and 1st class upgrades.All completely worth it... You could literally earn a few extra thousand bucks a month and travel lightly if that’s your thing. It can be that simple...#3 Video Production - Shooting videos for our clients, interviewing them and adding some additional 'B' roll footage and background music.[it's actually a lot easier than most people think with software that already comes loaded on your laptop in most cases]#4 Affiliate Offers - This is a BILLION dollar industry by itself. It's by simply referring offers from companies that I like and use their products myself. Here’s how it works:When I send emails about it and people buy the offer, I get paid. Its simple to do and no tech skills required for any of these ways I earn income really.#5 Hosting & Speaking at Events - We can charge business owners up to 5K to come to a live, in person workshop where we teach them the simple things that we would normally charge to do for them.Any of these can be learned much easier than you might believe...Here is what you need to know:Jon, a youtube marketer who works with business owners was losing thousands of dollars a month on Facebook Ads......he swallowed his pride and finally confessed this to me......then I taught him a few basic Facebook Ad strategies, and a year later...Over million dollars in revenue.So to get to the point... Do you want me to teach you what I showed Jon how to do as well as my other clients?If so, I'm holding a free training webinar where I will be revealing the exact strategies I taught Jon.Plus, if you sign up for the free webinar, the moment you sign up I’m going to immediately redirect you to a training video that shows you......what I showed Nathan, my kiwi student... who now generates 5 figures every month and travels the world full time... with a full time income.You can get all of that right here:http://mrthinkoutsidethebox.com/[Make sure to get on the list for the free webinar as well]If you have any desire to start a business online from scratch or learn how grow your business with Facebook ads then you need to be on that webinar.I'll see you there,Jubrilhttp://mrthinkoutsidethebox.com/",travel

    BEIRUT TRAVEL BLOG | LADIES MEET UP | FOOD, VIEWS, PARTIES
  ","Trip with my Girls to Beirut.We have been Best Friends for over 7 years now. Since we met we have gone through the best and the worst of times together. I believe his friendship was sent from heaven because my angels are flawless people and greatest friends. We have lived together in London and one-day circumstances have changed and we were separated, London, South of France and Dubai... so we needed a place to meet, bond and catch up on our lives. Lovely Maria has suggested Beirut as our destination. Not knowing much about that place other than its middle east with the unstable political situation and Syrian war next door we jumped on it :) And right we were! Beirut turned out to be a beautiful place fool of culture, art and greatest food. Best designers, couturiers and artists have come from Lebanon and Beirut is the hub.The food is amazing, we have had Lebanese and Armenian food that was insane. There is no place like Lebanon if you like Arabic food. Fool of flavour and love in every bite.I haven't shown the grand luxury scene of Beirut because we were in offseason and also no one really cares :) But if you do, Beirut has a massive Yacht bay just off city centre with insane skyscraper hotels and luxury apartments overlooking the bay area with Hermes, Dior, Gucci and Couture Dress designer boutiques like you've never seen before with gold embroidered dresses in the window displays. If that's your vibe, then it's definitely a place to visit.We have made a pact to come back to Beirut and explore more of Roman Empire racks, Bazars, Skiing resort and famous pine nut forest that is a symbol of Lebanon and reflected on the national flag.I would love to share knowledge about this beautiful place when we are there next time. But for now, enjoy the snippets of our trip and a photo slideshow.I really hope me and my Girls will have many more of these trips and we will be able to share it with our friends and spread the good vibes.If you like to follow us, please do... here are our insta links: Marina is a Stunning Luxury Expert https://www.instagram.com/marina_krl/ Maria is a Gorgeous Trend Setter https://www.instagram.com/marijaplavska/And I make Most Amazing Food https://www.instagram.com/dianavoroneca/See you soon,D",travel

Filmed in Vicenza, ItalyCopyright Mark Wolters 2016The Don'ts of Italy1. Don't expect to get discount prices on fancy Italian luxury brands. 2. Don't eat near tourist sights. You will be ripped off and not get as good of Italian food as you would away from the tourist sights.  3. Don't Tip. They already charge you for service. 4. You Don't have to scream louder to get people to understand you. 5. Don't worry about overdressing, the Italians will always look better than you.6. Don't just visit Rome and Venice, there is so much more to Italy. 7. Don't share your pizza and make sure you do eat it with your fork and knife.8. Don't use the fast trains for short distances, they are not worth the significantly higher prices. 9. Don't expect to see spaghetti and meatballs on the menu TOGETHER. They will be there separately, but not together. 10. Don't expect a big breakfast in Italy. Just coffee and a cookie. 11. Don't overpack. You will be limited on space when traveling in Italy so pack accordingly. 12. Don't expect to be served food in a restaurant between 3pm and 7pm.10 Things That Will SHOCK You About Visiting Italyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGhlk...10 Things That Will SHOCK You About Visiting The USAhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89aEo...10 Things That Will SHOCK You About Germanyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyHi2...

    Maui Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia
  ","As the second-largest island in the Hawaiian chain, Maui is home to less than 150,000 people. It makes up for its sparse population by drawing more than 2.4 million visitors per year, all of whom are drawn to its sparkling beaches, warm water, and lush tropical habitats. Polynesian and modern American lifestyles blend together in the Valley Isle. Maui’s legendary greenery, sprouting from fertile lava soil, has made it a popular place for hikes and scenic drives. Of course, its fascinating culture and history are also huge draws. Once you’ve arrived on the island, your Maui tour should kick off with the capital city, Wailuku, which is full of museums, pubs, and places to explore. Maui is not a large island, and in theory it’s easy to see all of it—after all, you can drive from one end to the other in less than three hours. Instead of taking the shortcut, though, do some Maui sightseeing around the perimeter. Rent a car and pull onto the Hana Highway, where you can view some of Hana’s beautiful, secluded spaces, like the Garden of Eden Arboretum. You can enjoy its stunning views of the ocean and bamboo forest for hours.Once you reach the other side of Hana, you’ll find Haleakala National Park, which is set on a dormant volcano. If you go hiking there in the morning, you’ll see a brilliant sunrise and truly understand why Haleakala means “the house of the sun.” But who are we kidding? You’re here for the beaches—and there are 80 of them. Whether you want to go snorkeling in the crystal clear waters of Molokini Island Preserve or commune with the turtles at Maluaka Beach, you’ll find the perfect watery habitat on Maui. If you want to learn how to surf, Kihe is the ideal place; with its gentle waves and affordable lodgings, you’ll be getting barreled in no time.From ancient culture to modern beachcombing adventures, Maui truly has it all. What kind of adventure will you have?Visit our Maui travel guide page for more information or to plan your next vacation!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on social media:Twitter: https://twitter.com/Expedia Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/expedia Instagram: http://instagram.com/expediaPinterest: http://www.pinterest.com/Expedia/Google+: https://plus.google.com/+Expedia --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Follow us on our travel blog, Viewfinder: http://viewfinder.expedia.com/",travel

    🎥 Sri Lankan Street Market - Food Travel Blog Colombo - Sri Lanka Vlog - Street Food Sri Lanka
  ","► SUBSCRIBE to lots of new videos every week: http://bit.ly/htcgYTsub🎥 Sri Lankan Street Market - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog - Street Food - Local market in a small village just outside Negombo. Every village has a market day, lots of dried fish and fresh vegetables. One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Kool is a seafood broth from Jaffna containing crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns, and crayfish. It also contains long beans, jak seeds, manioc, spinach, and tamarind. The dish is thickened with palmyra root flour. ""Short eats"" are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils. http://www.howtocookgreatfood.com - https://plus.google.com/+howtocookgre... - http://www.howtocookgreatethiopian.com - http://www.howtocookgreatjamaican.com - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com - http://www.howtocookgreatfilipino.com - https://www.facebook.com/howtocookgre... - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com/",travel

  ","Our new CHANNEL AD.!A decade of planning, saving and sacrifice to eventually live the dream of traveling the world by sea.  We sold all our belongings, quit our jobs, rented the house, took the kids out of school and searched for the best cruising boat we could afford, before we were finally ready to go sail the world's oceans.Our family vlogs tell the story of the amazing people we meet, the strange places we visit and the travel and adventures we have along the way. But they are also about the everyday trials and tribulations of trying to live off-grid, of remote working, making money as we travel, shopping, cooking, boat maintenance, home schooling, living on a budget and the everyday challenges of family life afloat.We'd love you to SUBSCRIBE to our channel and SHARE our adventure with friends and family who might just need that little nudge to step outside their comfort zone to live their dream too.. and perhaps learn a little from our mistakes!

    10 Must Know JAPAN Travel Tips No One Talks about ...like POLICE
  ","These Top 10 Japan Travel Tips are based on what I wish I knew before moving to Japan.  This serves as a Japan Guide for travelers planning Japan travel and what to do when stopped by a Japanese Police officer.  This Tokyo guide also shows what not do in Japan as well as things not do in Japan based on Japanese culture.  These Japanese Travel Tips cover Tattoos in a Japanese Onsen, Non-tipping culture, riding the train in Japan, Wifi in Japan, Japanese Hotels, Japanese Police, etc.  Basically, these are the things to know before going to Japan.  More information is listed below.Check out my Toe-Kyo Shirt Merch here- https://www.zazzle.com/paolofromtokyoFor more Japan related travel info, check out my site- https://www.tokyozebra.comTop 10 Japan Travel Tips You Should Know0:41 #1 Cash in Japan2:38 #2 Eating & Drinking While Walking4:17 #3 Drinking in Japan5:04 #4 Tattoos in JapanTattoo Friendly Onsen - Hot spring facilities in Tokyo - https://www.tokyozebra.com/blog/tatto...6:12 #5 Wifi & The InternetTokyo Wifi Spotshttp://www.wifi-tokyo.jp/spotmap.htmlSIM CARDAnother options is to get a SIM card for your unlocked mobile device.  You can go to most major electronics store and they should carry it.  There are a few options, but I’ll cover the 2 basic types that I think is the best  for travelers.  (1)  SIM card with a daily data transfer limits 220mb per day. You can get it for 7 days or 15 days.  (2) SIM cards with a total data transfer limit of 1.5 Gb or 3GB that work for 30 day period.  It doesn’t have a daily transfer limit which I personally prefer.  And if I use up all the data in only a few days, you can just buy a new card.

After 2 years of saving $ and travel hacking over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling. So we extended our 1 year trip to THREE years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before Nate turns 30 (which is March 20, 2019)! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",travel

    Ireland Travel | West Cork Travel | Irish Travel | Ireland Travels | Ireland Holiday | Ireland Blog
  ","http://www.ireland-travels.comhttps://www.facebook.com/IrelandTravelshttps://twitter.com/TravelsIrelandIreland travel is about taking a journey into the magical.  While taking a tour of Ireland you should always include time to travel West Cork.  You can experience more of the West Cork area at my Ireland blog using the links above.Whether you are walking the paths of the many parks, climbing the rocky hills, fishing from the rugged coastline, sitting on a sandy beach, taking photographs of the Irish countryside or cycling the winding roads; a tour of this scenic area of southwest County Cork, Ireland is a must.Begin your tour at Mizen Head, Ireland's most southwesterly point.  The dramatic peninsula features Barley Cove beach and is highlighted by the Mizen Head Signal Station Visitor Centre.  Be sure to look for seals lazily resting on the rocks below.On past the village of Crookhaven you will find yourself on Streek Head, a remote area accessible only through rolling Irish countryside and pastures.  This is a beautiful place to watch the sun rise from or set into the Atlantic Ocean.Near the quaint village of Skibbereen is the area of Lough Hyne.  Lough Hyne is a salt-water lake, fed by the tides, and is home to a varied collection of marine life.  Above the lake are the walking paths of Knockamagh Wood Nature Reserve, which is part of Ireland's national park system.  The paths of the nature preserve lead you to commanding views of Roaringwater Bay, Baltimore harbor and Clear Island.  A picnic is fantastic way to finish this walk.Further up the coast, near the County Kerry border, is the fishing village of Castletownbere. The village is situated on the southern edge of the Beara Peninsula and is near the beginning of the southern portion of the Ring of Beara.  Just out of town are the ruins of Dunboy Castle, which was destroyed by the English in 1602 after a 14-day siege.Priest's Leap is also located near the County Kerry Border and overlooks the world famous Bantry Bay.  Irish legend holds that a priest, while riding a horse and fleeing soldiers, jumped from this point and landed many miles away near Bantry.  Looking for a place for fishing in Ireland?  The pier at Toor Point has commanding views of the Atlantic Ocean and Toor Island.  A lazy, quiet afternoon can be spent watching the waves crash against the shoreline as the seagulls soar above you.Between the villages of Goleen and Durrus, you will find the Coast Road.  On this road is the well-preserved O'Mahoney Castle known as Dunmanus Castle.  The castle was built in 1430 at the current location of Dunmanus Harbor.  Views of the beautiful Irish countryside and Dunmanus Bay will have you reaching for your camera.Possibly the most beautiful place in all of West Cork is Three Castle Head.  The collection of three towers, built in 1207 by the O'Mahoneys, is a short hike from Dunlough Pier.  The castles sit on cliffs, which offer views of the Atlantic Ocean, Mizen Head, Sheep's Head and the mountains of County Kerry.  At the base of the castles is a lake.  Irish legend holds that a lady haunts the lake, while protecting the king's valuables that were thrown into the lake to guard them from attackers.Planning your next vacation to Ireland?

    🎥 Sri Lankan Cooking - Traditional Kitchen - Coconut Roti - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog
  ","🎥 Sri Lankan Cooking - Traditional Kitchen - Coconut Roti - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog - One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors. Foreign traders who brought new food items; influences from Indonesian cuisine and the cuisine of Southern India have all helped to shape Sri Lankan cuisine. Today, some of the staples of Sri Lankan cuisine are rice, coconut, and spices. The latter are used due to Sri Lanka's history as a spice producer and trading post over several centuries. Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Kool is a seafood broth from Jaffna containing crab, fish, cuttlefish, prawns, and crayfish. It also contains long beans, jak seeds, manioc, spinach, and tamarind. The dish is thickened with palmyra root flour. ""Short eats"" are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils. http://www.howtocookgreatfood.com - https://plus.google.com/+howtocookgre... - http://www.howtocookgreatethiopian.com - http://www.howtocookgreatjamaican.com - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com - http://www.howtocookgreatfilipino.com - https://www.facebook.com/howtocookgre... - http://www.howtocookgreatcurry.com/ - Roti (also known as chapati) is a flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent, made from stoneground wholemeal flour, traditionally known as atta, that originated and is consumed in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Maldives, Malaysia and Bangladesh. It is also consumed in parts of South Africa, Fiji, Mauritius, the southern Caribbean, particularly in Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Grenada, Barbados and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Its defining characteristic is that it is unleavened. Indian naan bread, by contrast, is a yeast-leavened bread. A kulcha in Indian cuisine is a bread-like accompaniment, made of processed flour (maida) leavened with yeast. The word roti is derived from the Sanskrit word रोटिका (roṭikā), meaning ""bread"".[4] Names in other languages are Hindi: रोटी; Assamese: ৰুটী; Nepali : रोटी; Bengali: রুটি; Sinhalese: රොටි; Gujarati: રોટલી; Marathi: पोळी; Odia: ରୁଟି; Malayalam: റൊട്ടി; Kannada: ರೊಟ್ಟಿ; Telugu: రొట్టి; Tamil: ரொட்டி; Urdu: روٹی‎; Punjabi: ਰੋਟੀ,ਫੂਲਕਾ; Thai: โรตี. It is also known as maani in Sindhi, ruti in Bengali and phulka in Punjabi and Saraiki. In Sri Lanka, probably the most popular type of roti is pol roti (coconut roti), made of wheat flour, kurakkan flour, or a mixture of both, and scraped coconut. Sometimes, chopped green chillies and onion are added to the mixture before cooking. These are usually thicker and harder than other roti types. They are usually eaten with curries, or some types of sambol or lunu miris and considered a main meal rather than a supplement. Another variety of roti popular in Sri Lanka is Kottu roti. Kottu roti is made up of paratha or godamba roti . Paratha/godamba roti is cut into small pieces. These pieces are small in size and rectangular or square in shape. Then on a square heating pan, vegetables, onions are allowed to be fried. Then eggs, cooked meat or fish are added to fried vegetables and allowed to be heated for a few minutes. Finally the pieces of cut paratha is added. All these ingredients are mixed using two square pieces of steel. A peculiar sound is deliberately made while the mixing is done[citation needed]. It is said that the first person who innovated kottu roti to save the remaining paratha at his restaurant made this noise to attract patrons to make them aware of the new delicacy[citation needed]. Depending upon what ingredients are used, there are vegetable, egg, chicken, beef, mutton and fish kottu roti.",travel

    Exploring Urk - Travel Vlog (Video Blog) Travel Netherlands 🇳🇱
  ","A guide to Urk, this is our second vlog (video blog) about Urk, a small fishing town in the ""bible belt"" of The Netherlands that still maintains its past traditions.More at http://secretsofaworldtraveller.com/2...Urk is a typical city were traditions from past still stand strong today. Especially on days like Urkerdag or Vlaggetjesdag people dress up in traditional clothing and perform chores and other things like they did back in the day. Urk is a very religious city and almost all inhabitants are or were fishermen. One of the traditions that still is going strong on a daily basis is men wearing golden earrings with ships on the waves. Some of them also have an earring with their name in the other ear. This tradition stems from back in the day when men from Urk drowned while at sea they would get a proper burial paid for by the city if they had gold in their ears. On days like Urkerdag or Vlaagetjesdag you can eat smoked salmon, smoked eel, fried kibbeling, salted raw herring and so on. But you can also buy things for your boat, old jewelry, cutlery, plates, and other knick-knacks. It is amazing to get a glance of this otherwise so closed community. While we were there we found out what Urk means and where it comes from. Urk used to be an island, until the former Zuiderzee became the lake IJsselmeer. It’s best known as a fishing village. At the harbor there is always loads of activity going on. You enjoy the action from a distance on one of the many terraces. The same harbor also offers all kinds of water sports opportunities.Highlights of UrkUrk's history goes back over one thousand years. Visit the old village and you can still feel the history it holds. Enjoy the beautiful surroundings by walking through the old village or from the water by boat. It’s highly recommended to eat some fresh fish in the harbor. You can also enjoy excellent fish dishes at one of the local restaurants. The nearby eel farm and a trip over the lake with the tourist line to Enkhuizen are also highly recommended.Visit UrkUrk is a small village with a great history, ideal for lovely walks. Charming shops, museums, beach, harbor and pool are within walking distance. Do note that the tourist line between Enkhuizen and Urk only sails in summertime. Most inhabitants of Urk consider Sunday a day of rest, so it’s best to visit Urk on weekdays or on a Saturday.Facts via Holland.comWebsite: http://secretsofaworldtraveller.comFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/secretsofawo...Twitter: https://twitter.com/SWorldTravellerGoogle Plus: https://plus.google.com/+Secretsofawo...-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-Please watch: ""A Month in China"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmTRg...-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",travel

    Aboriginal Art and Music
  ","A quick look at some aboriginal art .. All images taken from google images . The audio is from something called Songs From The Northern Territory 4Songs From the Northern Territory 4: Aboriginal Music From North-Eastern Arnhem Land Including Groote Eylandt Artist/Collector: Alice Moyle Label Information: Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS): AIAS 4 CD Media Type: CD Year: Recorded 1963; Released 1997 Availability: AIATSIS Notes: For the purpose of music description, Eastern Arnhem Land of the Northern Territory is divided here as follows: the north-eastern sector including offshore islands; the eastern sector, extending along the coast as far south as the Roper River; and the Groote Eylandt archipelago north-west of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Field recordings reproduced on this compact disc were collected at Milingimbi and Yirrkala in the north-eastern sector and at Angurugu and Umbakumba on Groote Eylandt. The Aboriginal communities at Milingimbi and Yirrkala, together with the people at Galiwin'ku (previously known as Elcho Island) have been referred to in the anthropological literature as the Murngin (WL Warner) and Wulamba (RM Berndt). More recently, they have become known as the Yolngu, from a local word meaning 'people'. The people on Groote Eylandt were known by mainland groups as the Wayingurra and their language, Ingurra. In the absence of a name for the Groote Eylandters, Warnindilyakwa, a name formerly given to one of the larger clans on the island, is sometimes used. Anindilyakwa is the name of the island language. Item characteristics of Eastern Arnhem Land clan songs performed and recorded in the 1960s-all of which were sung by men-are summarised here as follows: (1) a didjeridu accompaniment which utilises two tones differing widely in pitch (the interval between the higher or overblown tone and the fundamental often sounding close to a tenth but varying according to the shape and length of the hollowed branch); (2) a narrow vocal range of pitch (compare them, for instance, with Western Arnhem Land songs) which rarely exceeds a fifth or sixth and may be less than a second; (3) song words which are translatable, meaningful and appropriate to relevant clan territories and related myths; and (4) the occurrence of an unaccompanied vocal termination (UVT), or termination of a song item by voice or voices alone after the accompanying instruments have ceased. Good examples of this fourth item characteristic are to be heard on this disc (Track 1) and disc 3 (Track 11). Song refrains may consist of repeated strings of words and syllables, a prolonged single syllable or a repeated pattern of vocal sounds (for example, bird calls). These calls are incorporated into the particular sectional or phraselike structure of many item sequences performed in Eastern Arnhem Land. On Groote Eylandt (tracks 7-13), only the first three of the above characteristics are to be heard. There is no occurrence of the UVT in these items but the following additional characteristics distinguish emeba (Groote Eylandt clan songs) from manikay (north-eastern Arnhem Land clan songs): a. the shaky voice, a deliberate manner of vocal ornamentation used by some emeba singers; b. the break or brief cessation of the vocal part of a Groote Eylandt clan song which is signalled by certain words the singer chooses to sing (the song subject at this point may fall, swoop down, or change abruptly in some way-it was said that the break gives the singer time to decide which words to sing next); c. a short, patterned interplay between sticks and didjeridu during the break; and d. the general clatter of stick-beating percussion arising from several different sources at the same time. Further comparison of emeba and manikay reveals that, whereas the durations of the latter are usually about one minute or less, emeba items may last for more than two minutes each.Manikay.comIt is such a shame that so much aboriginal culture has been lost .. Its good to see that some remains .",art and music

    How art and music create a new hybrid global culture: Rajae El Mouhandiz at TEDxBreda
  ","The ""one story"" of Muslims and immigrants we hear in the news and politics every day is ignoring the many stories of millions of women and men who do not see themselves in that old story, but as authors and owners of a new story where globalism and hybrid cultures are the stage and vehicle. They represent a new story of being and belonging in the world. A story where history is honoured as the sacrifices of those who came before us. Their parents moved to the west to start something new, mixed with the old, and individuals like Rajae El Mouhandiz are the product. As the new stories they are shaping do not yet have a language and a platform, one has to start telling the stories through art and music. And personal strength.Regarding Rajae El MouhandizRajae El Mouhandiz is a Dutch-Moroccan-Algerian poet, singer, composer, producer, and founder of the record label Truthseeker Records. After leaving her family at age 15 and being the first Moroccan to study at a Dutch conservatory at age 16. El Mouhandiz left classical music at age 20 to follow her own artistic path, seeking to incorporate her cultural roots. She started her own record label at age 25, released two albums and is currently developing her third album in Morocco. On international women's day 2013 El Mouhandiz premiered her first short documentary film, about the acceptance of Muslim women in mainstream media and the music industry. Currently she is developing her second short film, focusing on her Maghreb heritage and the story of her grandfathers. She is also one of the 60 female curators of the groundbreaking international MUSLIMA exhibition, held in The USA, The Philipines, The U.A.E and Denmark. And together with the British Council Ireland and a Dutch theatre production company, El Mouhandiz is producing the Dutch and European version of the Hijabi Monologues; a theatre space for the experiences of Muslim women; a space to breathe as they are; a space that does not claim to tell every story and speak for every voice. The Dutch premiere is planned in September 2014. Rajae was nominated as Muslim Leader of tomorrow in 2005. She was nominated by Elsevier magazine as one of Hollands' 10 biggest talents in 2007, in the field of contemporary music and from 2009 -- 2012 she was the only female contemporary artist to be nominated on the list of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world.

  ","In our fifth and final 'Hangout on Air', Miranda Sawyer is joined by artist Haroon Mirza, music producer Will Skeaping, record sleeve designer Leif Podhajsky and Tate's Adrian Shaw for a lively discussion about music and art.Miranda Sawyer is a journalist, writer and broadcaster covering a wide range of interests, including music, art, radio and theatre. She is currently a feature writer and radio critic for The Observer, and is a regular arts critic in print and on television and radio. Miranda is also on the board of Tate Members.Haroon Mirza is a British artist who combines a variety of readymade and time based material to create audio compositions, which are often realised as site-specific installations. In doing so, Mirza complicates the distinctions between noise, sound and music, and alters the function and meaning of everyday objects and and socio-cultural constructs.Adrian Shaw is part of Tate’s Learning department, working on the Young People’s Programme. He has been organising music events since the early 1990’s and introduced large scale music programming to Tate over 10 years ago.  Now established as ‘Late at Tate’, these events often explore the boundaries between music, performance and art.  Adrian is also a musician, and one half of the arts duo boyleANDshaw.Will Skeaping is a creative consultant and music producer. Following a tour of duty at Google, he worked closely with rappers, authors and film makers as label manager at Lex Records, focusing on collaborations between artists and musicians.

    Music is a visual art | Hunter Ewen | TEDxBoulder
  ","This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. We can use visuals to better describe music. Hunter Ewen is a dramatic music composer, educator, and multimedia designer. During the day, Dr. Ewen teaches strategies for digital creativity at the University of Colorado, the children’s collaborative art center Reel Kids, the City of Longmont, and as an independent educator. At night, he composes, solders, choreographs, and directs interdisciplinary projects around the world. Experimental performance practices and unusual notation figure prominently in Ewen’s works. A believer that compositions should be both seen and heard, his music looks as strange as it sounds. Swirles, squiggles, arrows, and fangs often replace traditional notes and rests. His aesthetic preferences gravitate towards yowls and yips and wails and squeals. Towards screams that masquerade as art. Towards clamor and deviance. Ewen’s music swings from chandeliers.About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.

    Engineering and Music: A Powerful Duet for Art and Science - Science Nation
  ","University of Rochester electrical engineer Mark Bocko has combined his passion for music with his passion for engineering, devising a way to digitally reproduce music in files 1,000 times smaller than an mp3! But along with this new type of compression, Bocko's team of engineers and musicians at Rochester's Eastman School of Music are also helping uncover some extraordinarily precise details about just how music is made. With support from the National Science Foundation, they have built a computer model of the clarinet, entirely from real world acoustical measurements taken from human musicians. Measuring such things as how hard the musician is blowing into the instrument and the pressure the musician applies to the reed, they have modeled the way music is made. Their work could evolve into a cool new tool for music teachers and help create more expressive, more emotional computer generated musical sounds.

    With One Voice in Montreal: Art and Music Helping Homeless People.
  ","""Art to me is a humanitarian act and I believe that there is a responsibility that art should somehow be able to effect mankind, to make the world a better place.""  ~ Jeff KoonsSomething I don't talk about very often is that at its very core Invisible People is art. Years ago, my boss at the time had in his office a coffee table book of photos of homeless people. The pictures humanized homeless men, woman, and families as the real people that they are. I said to myself: ""I could do this with video."" Shortly after, I was laid off and Invisible People was started. If you'd like to learn more about my story and how Invisible People started, please watch this documentary https://youtu.be/z0wDn9SAWZsArt and music have the power to bring people together and change our world for the better. Both art and music can play a huge role in giving homeless people a purpose. Yes, housing ends homelessness but just putting homeless people in boxes will never end homelessness. People need to thrive and not just survive. Art therapy and music therapy are powerful tools for wellness, and as you'll see in this vlog - art, music, and theater can be used for advocacy to help change policy. Last year, With One Voice sent a delegation to the ATSA État d'Urgence Festival in Montreal, Canada. It was an amazing few days meeting new friends and brainstorming on how we can help other creative organizations scale to have more impact helping homeless people. I shot a bunch of footage but never got around to editing it into something until this month. My dream is someday to be able to produce mini-documentaries like this vlog highlighting cool ideas and amazing people working to end homelessness who may not always get a lot of media attention.  For example, in this vlog, I reference a video I shot when I was invited to the Dallas Public Library that you can watch here: https://youtu.be/_SaG0xR7xkU The folks behind With One Voice saw this video and invited Jo and Heather to Montreal to share about creating safe spaces. I hope to one day be able to produce more like this but on a much larger scale! In her interview, Beth Knowles from the City of Manchester and With One Voice references the North America Review of Arts and Homelessness that you can find here: http://with-one-voice.com/north-ameri...From With One Voice's website: With One Voice began as a showcase event curated by Streetwise Opera at the 2012 Cultural Olympiad in London. For the first time in Olympic history, it gave a platform for homeless people – celebrating the artistic achievements of 300 performers who had experienced homelessness.To learn more about the people and the organizations in this video, here is a link to information about the delegates https://www.atsa.qc.ca/en/eu-2017-wit...

    'Hey Bill Nye, What's the Evolutionary Purpose of Music and Art?'
  ","If you're interested in licensing this or any other Big Think clip for commercial or private use, contact our licensing partner Executive Interviews: https://www.executiveinterviews.biz/r...The impulse to create art and music comes from deep evolutionary drives, explains Bill Nye the Science Guy. In the animal kingdom, song and visual displays are great tools for, um, flirting.Read more at BigThink.com: http://bigthink.com/videos/bill-nye-o...Follow Big Think here:YouTube: http://goo.gl/CPTsV5Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/BigThinkdotcomTwitter: https://twitter.com/bigthinkTranscript: Michael Montoya: Hi Bill. Michael Montoya here. What do you think is the evolutionary advantage to humanity being both musically and artistically creative? And where do you think this initial spark of creativity came from?Bill Nye: Michael. Michael. This is a great question and susceptible to speculation. Apparently music and art is part of the way we communicate and it's certainly the way you attract mates. I'll just put it to you that way. Musicians and artists engage other people in a way that people who don't use music and don't use art do not. Now, there's a lot of talk about songbirds in evolutionary biology and they all have these songs, which must be pleasing to the ears of their potential mates and also must send messages to others of their species, so I guess to other species as well. I am angry; this is my territory; I'm looking for a mate; it's a sunny day. These sort of announcements are made by other species so you figure humans have just taken it just a whole other level with albums and record release parties and art exhibits and art museums and art galleries. So it really is deep within us and I think art enriches our lives, engages our brains and stimulates us in a way that nothing else we do does. So, this is only speculation on my part but music especially certainly inspires us. That's for sure. So carry on Michael. Turn it up loud.",art and music

    Arnold Schönberg - Wassily Kandinsky: Music and Art Get One
  ","The early years of the 20th Century signed a terrific advance in the Physical Sciences. The Special (1905) and General (1916)  Theories of Relativity and the advent of Quantum Mechanics (1926) changed our lives profoundly. Around the same years, a similar revolution took place in both Music and Art. The year 1909 marks a decisive break with tonality (the structure of classical music) by Arnold Schönberg in his ""Three Piano Pieces"". The term 'Atonality' is commonly used to express this new type of composition. Wassily Kandinsky is credited with painting the first 'purely abstract' works. His production is vast and I could only include 20 of his works here, selected from a period of time that overlaps with the musical pieces by Schönberg presented in this video. They knew each other and have possibly influenced their works reciprocally. The video is an attempt to evince this intriguing 'connection' between music and painting.About Arnold Schönberg (1874-1951):...The final piece (of the Three Piano Pieces, Op.11) breaks through all constraints of traditional language or structure, cutting abruptly from extremes of eruptive power, as in the massively congested opening, to the most intense introspection. Perhaps Schoenberg had in mind Kandinsky, with whom he had close  contacts, when he likened such music to developments in painting -""without architecture... an ever-changing, unbroken succession of colours, rhythms and moods."" (From a Text by Peter Hill).About Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944):...As the ""Der Blaue Reiter""(*) Almanac essays and theorizing with composer Arnold Schönberg indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind (Synesthesia). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that, for instance, yellow is the colour of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships, claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul.

    Why Artists Don't Make Money - The Business of Life (Episode 3)
  ","This episode of 'The Business of Life' looks at two creative industries going in seemingly opposite trajectories: the fine art world, where the sky is seemingly the limit for the prices collectors are willing to pay; and the music industry, where the free-fall of record company profits has only recently begun to slow.But at the root of each sector’s rising or declining fortunes is the underlying question: How should we compensate artists? And what value do cultural products create in a society? To get to the bottom of the issue, we’ve tapped the former New Yorker pop critic Sasha Frere-Jones, award-winning artist Ryder Ripps, and Glenn O’Brien, the founder of TV Party, original editor of Interview Magazine, and a former member of Andy Warhol’s Factory.Watch “How the US Workforce is Changing (Episode 1)” - http://bit.ly/1I4IvVWWatch ""This is the Modern American Family (Episode 2)” - http://bit.ly/1A6yp5eAll content is the sole property of VICE News.

  ","DOWNLOAD LINK: https://www.dropbox.com/s/i74kt5p8srf...You can check me out at:https://soundcloud.com/crmmusic12,000 views in one day! Thank you so much to the community for the support and kind words, they mean the absolute world to me!Original music for #GeekandSundry's #CriticalRoleSO this piece took research to pull off, I'd read that Matt had based a lot of Wildemount's culture off of real life Eastern European examples and I remember hearing a while back that his favourite instrument was violin so I implemented a mix of Eastern European folk music (Polish, Hungarian, etc.) into a very rhythmic orchestral. I'd started this piece a few days prior to the first episode so the fact that they're using music from the Witcher series actually coincides quite well with this. You may have noticed but I also worked Jason Charles Miller's original main theme into the ending and a violin passage mixed in with my own theme. I'll go into a more in depth analysis if enough people want to know how this was made.",art and music

    Creativity Music for Writing, Art, Work etc. - Focus & Creativity (With Binaural Beats)
  ","Creativity Music for Writing, Art, Work etc. - Focus & Creativity (With Binaural Beats) MP3 DOWNLOAD: https://www.brainwavehub.com/download...Using a combination of Theta, Alpha and Beta frequencies, this audio is designed to act as an aid to your creative pursuits, encourage fluid, abstract thought processes while maintaining focus over long periods. The Theta / Beta frequencies range from 6-7hz & 13-15hz respectively, with 8-12hz alpha waves interspersed throughout. The patterns switch in the following manner, every 5 minutes: 0-5 mins - Alpha / Beta; 5-10 mins - Theta / Alpha; 10 - 15 mins -Alpha / Beta; etc. etc.  up to one hour. This quick interplay between beta and theta/alpha promotes a balance between concrete thought and creative abstraction. This way we can encourage and bring to light new insights, generate new & original ideas, contemplate a concept from various points of view, and problem solve holistically. The beta phases serve to not only promote focus and concentration, but to also analyse, organise and therefore make sense of the abstractions derived from the more non linear holistic mind states induced by Theta and Alpha. In addition to using this audio during work or study, you can also use it in a rested state while meditating to assist with creative visualisation. As binaural beats have been integrated into this track, we recommend using headphones. Subscribe to The Brainwave Hub for the best brainwave entrainment audios, as well as our partner channel, The Meditation Music Hub: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCydP...--The Brainwave Hub offers high quality binaural beats and isochronic tones.

Emmanuel Gorrin is a junior student of neuroscience with a penchant for the arts — drawing, painting, and piano have been among his passions since childhood. Now, his interests lie in the role of art, music and technology in neural functioning and the advancement of medicine. He is the founder and President of Neuromission, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping people with neurological disorders by integrating art, music and innovative technology. Emmanuel also hosts Get Smart! On WVUM 90.5 fm and can be heard discussing all things science each Tuesday at 7pm. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",art and music

    Art and Incarceration:  Poetry, Theatre and Music in and about Captivity
  ","For this interdisciplinary performance, Ensemble Pi presented music, text, and theater works that focus on the rise of mass incarceration, the racial disparities it reveals, and the emotional toll it takes on inmates and their families. The evening started with the world premiere of Rikers Island by New York composer Eleanor Cory, inspired by the anthology These Are Hard Times for Dreamers. Followed by Rzewski’s minimalist masterpiece, Coming Together, composed in the wake of the 1971 prison riots in upstate New York and powerfully expressing the frustration of life behind bars and anger about injustice. Joseph Assadourian, the narrator for Coming Together, will also perform an excerpt from his tragi-comic play, The Bullpen, based on his own incarceration. The performance closed with the sublime Olivier Messiaen’s Quartet for the End of Time (1941), composed and performed in the prisoner-of-war camp in Gorlitz, Germany, capturing the hardship and sadness of being in prison, while still conveying optimism.About the presenters:Ensemble Pi is a new music collective that uniquely connects pressing social and political issues and the idioms of classical contemporary music. They began a Peace Concerts series 10 years ago in response to the invasion of Iraq, and have since presented annual chamber music concerts giving voice to the struggle for peace. Every concert includes at least one commission, as well as contemporary classical masterpieces to address the historical tradition of “socially conscious” compositions. In the past, the group has collaborated with visual artists, writers, journalists and actors – including South African artist William Kentridge and American journalists Naomi Wolf and Jeremy Scahill – and have featured the music of John Harbison, Frederic Rzewski, Shostakovich and Penderecki. The Peace Concerts series has also protested the censorship of media, fracking, the Apartheid, and more. Performers include: Alexis Gerlach, cello; Moran Katz, clarinet; Idith Meshulam Korman, piano; Airi Yoshioka, violin; and Joseph Assadourian, actor and narrator. The group is joined by local Houston musicians Craig Hauschildt, percussion and Daniel Egan, trumpet.c Rothko Chapel/Runaway Productions",art and music

    Katawa Shoujo Beta - Shizune Act 3 (Full Art and Music)
  ","Here is Shizune's Act 3. The official Steam forum dedicated to repairing the beta routes did not completely finish giving Shizune's route art and music direction, so I fixed it up myself. Knowing how to mod has never generated so many feels.This is a playthrough of Shizune's Act 3 in the Beta of Katawa Shoujo. Act 1 was skipped due to it being exactly the same aside from the music and some grammar errors. Act 2 has been uploaded at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4z3Rmw... I will upload Act 4 at some point in time, but I figured I should at least upload something pertaining to the beta route as of now instead of holding off everything.I decided to keep the beta music in, but upon my insertion of art and music I put in some of the final version's music instead. The beta music just seems to fit the majority of the story in this route much better.I came across a rather disturbing, yet slightly expected option in the beta that was either omitted or never finished. As it turns out, you could end up having sex with Misha at Shizune's house. During the scene where Misha confesses her love for Shizune, there was going to be a decision at some point in the conversation where you could choose to comfort her or refuse. If you do not comfort her, she tells you that she had a selfish thought that you would (this is shown at about 1:23:34 in the video) This effects multiple scenes, the most notable one being that Hisao and Misha agree to never tell Shizune about the affair. This in turn would not actually effect the story at all, but feelings of utter guilt would be inserted throughout many scenes. The most ridiculous part is that you could still get a good ending with Shizune, even after cheating on her, but I'll get into more detail about that once Act 4 comes along. For now, I will hold off the spoilers.Katawa Shoujo is a bishoujo-style visual novel set in the fictional Yamaku High School for disabled children, located somewhere in modern Japan. Hisao Nakai, a normal boy living a normal life, has his life turned upside down when a congenital heart defect forces him to move to a new school after a long hospitalization. Despite his difficulties, Hisao is able to find friends—and perhaps love, if he plays his cards right. There are five main paths corresponding to the 5 main female characters, each path following the storyline pertaining to that character. This is the beta.",art and music

    GCP Online Meetup #53: Using Machine Learning to Create Art and Music
  ","Magenta is a research project exploring the role of machine learning in the process of creating art and music. Primarily this involves developing new deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms for generating songs, images, drawings, and other materials. But it's also an exploration in building smart tools and interfaces that allow artists and musicians to extend (not replace!) their processes using these models. Magenta was started by some researchers and engineers from the Google Brain team but many others have contributed significantly to the project. We use TensorFlow and release our models and tools in open source on our GitHub (https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta).For more details and demos please go to g.co/magenta.

    Discover the Art of Ben Heine: Drawing, Painting, Photography, Music, Teaching, Pencil Vs Camera...
  ","Presentation of Ben Heine Arthttps://www.benheine.comhttps://www.instagram.com/benheineBen Heine is a Belgian multidisciplinary artist and music producer born in 1983 in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, currently living and working in Brussels, Belgium. He is best known for his original series “Pencil Vs Camera“, “Digital Circlism” and “Flesh and Acrylic“. He has a Master degree in Journalism completed at IHECS school of Journalism in Brussels. He also briefly studied History of Art, Painting and Sculpture at Hastings College of Arts & Technology in the UK. He is a self-taught person in drawing, photography and music. Throughout his academic training, he was also able to learn several music instruments (drums and piano) and several languages (French, English, Dutch Polish, Spanish and Russian). His artworks were exhibited in countless fairs and galleries in Belgium, Hong Kong, South Korea, the UK, Russia, Romania, The Netherlands, Italy, Germany, France, Canada, the US, Turkey, Brazil, and Spain. His works have been published in some of the most famous newspapers and magazines. Ben is an enthusiastic traveller, he loves discovering new cities and cultures, each one of them being a huge source of inspiration for his creative projects. Through his career path, Heine became the ambassador of famous brands such as Samsung and Mazda and he has worked for other clients such as Harbour City, Diesel, Turismo de Canarias, Semmel-Concerts, Kare Design, Moscow Planetarium, McCann Erickson, while still making time for personal projects. He started producing and composing music in 2012. A documentary about his work was released in 2012. Ben is married to Marta and they have two children. Ben’s father Hubert Heine was a commercial engineer and his mother Cathy Lebizay a choreographer and a dance teacher.Pencil Vs Camera is an original visual concept invented and popularized by Ben Heine since April 2010. A new art form and the artist’s special trademark, it is also one of the most creative and powerful art concepts of the 21st century. The images in this series usually show a hand-drawn sketch held and photographed by the artist to infuse ordinary scenes with new surreal, visionary, or romanticized narratives. Ben’s visible hand represents the connection between the viewer, the artist and the artwork. Heine does not recreate photographs, but he reimagines them. In these images, he likes to tell a story and convey timeless messages using imagination, illusion, poetry and surrealism. Since 2012, many smartphone applications emulate Heine’s Pencil Vs Camera’s style. Several other artists have also borrowed from Heine’s innovations to create variations of his Pencil Vs Camera. They say imitation is the highest form of flattery. The concept has also become popular in many primary and secondary schools worldwide. It is used to stimulate students’ imagination and encourage them to use new technologies and share their ideas.",art and music

    Mathematics, Music, and Visual Art
  ","Bridges 4: Mathematics, Music, and Visual ArtOur talks will explore some of the many connections between mathematics, music, and visual arts, using as a springboard our collaborative work-in-progress with the Kitchener-Waterloo symphony, to be premiered in April 2016. Dmitri will begin by describing the deep similarities between the languages of music and geometry, showing how elementary musical terms like “chord” and “voice leading” correspond to geometrical concepts like “vectors in an orbifold.” This correspondence in turn allows us to appreciate the hidden logic of particular pieces, the development of styles, and entire genres. Nathan will continue by showing how mathematical ideas can underwrite visually and conceptually striking visual art. The speakers will then join forces to describe some of the challenges and opportunities of using these ideas in creating a multimedia performance.Nathan Selikoff plays with interactivity and motion in time and space. Inspired by the behavior of systems, science, nature, and music, he combines computer code, traditional materials, and future technology to bring new ideas to life. His award-winning artwork has been exhibited and performed in galleries and venues throughout the United States and around the world. Selikoff is represented by Snap! Space in Florida, Bangkok, and Amsterdam.Dmitri Tymoczko’s book A Geometry of Music is available from Oxford University Press, and his CDs Beat Therapy and Crackpot Hymnal are available from Bridge Records.

    The Art of Punk - Black Flag - Art + Music - MOCAtv
  ","On the first episode of ""The Art of Punk"" we dissect the art of the legendary Black Flag. From the iconic four bars symbols, to the many coveted and collected gig flyers, singles, and band t-shirts, all depicting the distinctive Indian ink drawn image and text by artist Raymond Pettibon. We start off in Los Angeles talking to two founding members singer Keith Morris, and bass player Chuck Dukowski, about what the scene was like in 1976 - setting the stage for the band's formation, as well as the bands name, and the creation of the iconic four bars symbol. Raymond Pettibon talks with us from his New York art studio. Back in LA we meet with Flea, from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, about how the art, the music, and that early LA scene impacted his own life and career. To wrap it all up we sit and talk at length, with Henry Rollins, at MOCA Grand Ave in Los Angeles, about all of the above and more. Created, directed, and Executive Produced by writer/author of 'Fucked Up + Photocopied', Bryan Ray Turcotte (Kill Your Idols), and Bo Bushnell (The Western Empire), The Art Of Punk traces the roots of the punk movement and the artists behind the iconic logos of punk bands such as: Black Flag (Raymond Pettibon), The Dead Kennedys (Winston Smith), and Crass (Dave King).In addition to profiling the artists, the series includes intimate interviews with former band members, notable artists, and celebrities who have been heavily influenced by the art of punk rock including Jello Biafra, Tim Biskup, Scott Campbell, Chuck Dukowski, Flea, Steve Olson, Penny Rimbaud, Henry Rollins, Owen Thornton, and Gee Vaucher.The filmmakers Bryan Ray Turcotte and Bo Bushnell take a unique approach to exploring the rich histories of these three seminal punk legends by focusing on the influential imagery and seeking out stories that have not been told yet through the artwork, which is integral to the importance and influence of each band.On June 11, 2013 The Art Of Punk debuts on MOCAtv with an episode on Raymond Pettibon and the artwork of Black Flag. The stories behind the art of the Dead Kennedys will debut on June 18, and June 25 will see the release of the Crass episode, all of which will be available at: www.youtube.com/MOCAtvCreated By:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEhttps://twitter.com/bryanraymond www.KillYourIdols.comBO BUSHNELLhttps://twitter.com/BoBushnellInstagram.com/BoBushnellhttp://bobushnell.comDIRECTED BY:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEBO BUSHNELLEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:EMMA REEVESJOHN TOBAEXECUTIVE PRODUCERS:BRYAN RAY TURCOTTEBO BUSHNELLSTARRING:RAYMOND PETTIBONKEITH MORRISCHUCK DUKOWSKIHENRY ROLLINSFLEACAMERA:JOSH WEBBERBO BUSHNELLJASON BAKEREDITED BY:TIM BROOKSBEAST EDITORIALASSISTANT EDITOR:PAUL JAROLIMEKPRONERBEAST EDITORIALLOCATION SOUND:NOAH ALEXANDERCHARLES EASTMONDMOTION GRAPHIC DESIGN:BRENT STANGELMUSIC SUPERVISION:BETA PETROLMUSIC BY:RAW NERVETHEME MUSIC:SON THE FATHER by FUCKED UPCOURTESY BEGGARS GROUPADDITIONAL MUSIC BY:C.R.A.S.H.SCANNING BY:JESSE SPEARSSOUND MIXING:PHIL LANTZM SQUARED PRODUCTIONSCOLORIST:TIM BROOKSPHOTO STILLS PROVIDED BY:BRIAN TUCKERED COLVERSPOTRYAN RICHARDSONLike MOCA on Facebook: http://bit.ly/MOCAFacebookFollow MOCA on Twitter: http://bit.ly/MOCATwitter+1 MOCA on Google+: http://bit.ly/MOCAGooglePlusLike MOCA on Facebook: http://bit.ly/MOCAFacebookFollow MOCA on Twitter: http://bit.ly/MOCATwitter+1 MOCA on Google+: http://bit.ly/MOCAGooglePlusArtIsForYou20",art and music

Here is more about the festival as taken from the official website, http://escapefestival.in: ""A unique festival started in May 2009 when a few musicians and like-minded people decided to get away from New Delhi for a few days. They chose a picturesque resort at Naukuchiatal, at the foothills of the Himalayas which became their Escape.Escape, has grown since then to become one of India's foremost outdoor art, music & camping festival.The Escape Festival of Art and Music, which has established itself in the past four years, is the perfect way to spend some quality time with friends and family. It is also one of the first festivals in the country set around a scenic getaway appealing to young and old alike. Three days. Two stages. One pristine lake. The lilt of music in the hills, the sublime experience of art, the unfettered sense of joy as you give into the magic of the moment.Enough reasons to escape amidst the serene surroundings of Naukuchiatal. The three-day Escape Festival of Arts and Music, in its 6th Chapter in 2013, has slowly but surely become the cause of a mass exodus of all music fans from the summer heat. The Escape Festival of Art & Music addresses the needs of a wide group of artists and audience by bringing them together under one roof. It sets the benchmark in showcasing talent and creating a unique atmosphere of creative exchange and camaraderie amongst its attendees. The 'real time' experience coalesces into a unique experience which can only have the fitting title term of 'Escape'. An initiative by Potheads, the Escape Festival of Art & Music, is a creative retreat and will feature bands, artists, writers, photographers, painters, graffiti artists, performance artists, tattoo artists and potters, in a mélange of talent. In addition to that, the festival will also feature a festival camp, adventure sports and a flea market at the breathtaking venue right on the shores of Lake Naukuchiatal, Uttrakhand. The Escape Festival of Art and Music, which has established itself in the past four years, is the perfect way to spend some quality time with friends and family.In its 6th Chapter, The Escape Festival of Art and Music 2013 will see the performances spread over three days and two stages - The Soul Garden Stage and the Magic Forest Stage.The Soul Garden is aimed at a listening audience with the lake as a backdrop for the stage. This stage will feature some of the most musically talented artists from the genres of Jazz, Blues, Folk, Sufi and Rock Music from the four corners of IndiaThe Magic Forest is an EDM (Electronic Dance Music) Stage supported by an elaborate array of lights and visuals. The Magic Forest Stage will feature National and International Artists from the EDM sub-genres of Chill, Dub-step, Drum'n'Bass and Psytrance Music.The festival also features a mini film festival, which is the screening of independently produced documentaries by National and International film makers.In the areas of Photography, Painting, Pottery, Graffiti and other art forms outdoor exhibitions, live painting, workshops and participation programs will be the order of the day wherein one will experience art in a natural setting.""If you missed it the last time around, don't miss it next year.*********************************************************************************A Kunzum TV Production by Ajay JainCreatives by madpauleMusic: Track ""The Crosses of Annagh.

    Convergence 2016: Electronic Music + Visual Art
  ","When it comes to Electronic Music + Visual Art, we have entered into a post-instrument era in which music and visual art born of technology produce contemporary, dynamic and convergent new forms. Traditional apparatus and techniques are displaced by computer based processes, virtual instruments, electronic hardware and custom machines, stems, patches, waveforms and midi. This inaugural residency welcomes artists working in rhythmic and experimental electronic music realms, digital visual artists, and those pursuing work that creates synergies between sound, music and art.This Banff Centre residency provided the context for artists to research, conceive, prototype and present new artistic works, tools, techniques and perspectives for electronic music, sound, and visual creation. Under the artistic direction of Patti Schmidt and Jen Mizuik, and led by faculty Robin Fox and Uwe Schmidt with guest faculty who are specialists in their fields, the program offered sessions and workshops on modular synthesizers, electronic music software and hardware, visual creation software and methods, artistic process and philosophy, and the nature of live performance in these technologically dominated fields. Together artists, peers, and world-renowned faculty exchanged knowledge, discussed ideas, experimented with processes, created, collaborated, performed, and shared artistic experiences.Artists presented their works-in-progress throughout the program. The nature of the practices involved determined the presentation format and ranged from live performances, informal presentations, installations, talks and workshops. Artists received technical and artistic guidance during the development of their projects and research. This video gives a glimpse into the coolness that was the 2016 Convergence Residency.Follow the Banff Centre:Website: https://banffcentre.caFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheBanffCentreTwitter: https://twitter.com/thebanffcentreiTunes: http://apple.co/1A2DMmxSoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/banff-centre-r...",art and music

But when the channel took off I realised that I should prioritise making more regular content over one big video so I've spent the past year working on this one bit by bit between other videos. I'm so glad to finally be able to share it with you guys!Given how long it took to make, it went through many changes. It started as a Chapter 3 song but as time went by it ended up including parts of Chapter 4 and 5 too!A huge amount of work went into this one (over 1000 drawings!) so I want to thank everyone who helped and supported me along the way! All of the drawings, animation, lyrics and voices are my own. But if you find a spelling mistake, my girlfriend did the spell checking. ;)If you enjoyed the video, please do share! This is a super special project for me and I'd love for everyone to get a chance to see it!So as I now finally get to work on my next song, I hope in the mean time...

  ","There is something about this artwork and music  that touches one's soul. This particular piece (as with the others found at the Ancient Arrow site) is very busy, almost overwhelming to the eye.  I have tried to break it down for the eye and then put it back together again. The idea behind the paintings is that there is meaning in the symbols and there is communication that is going on at a deeper (subconscious?) level than we may readily perceive with our limited senses. The meaning of this piece is left up to the viewer and that is how it is and should be with all good art /music and myth I might add.  The work, for me, has spiritual meaning, yet if I was asked to tell you what exactly this piece is about, I could not. There is something sensual here to my ears and eyes, a multi-course feast (if you will) that the Creator (James?)  has brought together. This art and music is rumored to be from 'another universe.' It is modified (or somewhat diluted)  from the original because we don't have the same capabilities to perceive it display it and/or recreate it that the beings who created it have developed over eons. For instance, it is said that the pictures move or come alive when viewed in the individual chambers where they were found. Few have witnessed it . It is music and art that supposedly activates long dormant parts of our DNA, DNA that was intentionally genetically manipulated or altered by beings from other parts of the universe many thousands of years ago. Some on earth might have called them ""gods."" This is an ongoing, unfolding project designed by it's creators, the Lyricus teaching order, to open us up to dimensions we have here-to-fore not experienced. I am told we are now on the threshold of being ready for at least part of the information it can impart.

This discussion spills over into debates about art's value to society ---- whether access to the arts is right as basic as education or health care, and whether it should be assessed and supported by government or left to the ""invisible hand"" of the free market. President Botstein explains why it is essential to ask these questions and offers a sturdy basis for evaluating them.

    Art and Music are Antidotes to Intolerance: Shubha Mudgal
  ","Shubha Mudgal, noted composer and singer of Hindustani classical music as well as an archivist of enterprises, has launched initiatives like www.sangeetkosh.net and www.underscorerecords.com with partner Aneesh Pradhan. Most of all a voice of resistance and protest, Shubha speaks to Communalism Combat about her personal journey. As a young student who grew up in the rich cultural and academic milieu of Allahabad, Shubha began with kathak dancing, worked as a broadcaster with All India Radio and from the proceeds of her hard earned work bought her first tanpura.  Shubha then trained in Hindustani classical music under Pandit Ramashreya Jha in Allahabad, later Pandit Vinay Chandra Maudgalya in Delhi.In this free-wheeling conversation with Teesta Setalvad, she speaks of the rich values of diversity that the Hindustani music and arts culture encapsulates, also recalling wonderful anecdotes of how leaders of the national movement like Nehru and Gandhi involved a vast array of Indians, including less visible citizens to participate in the ousting of British rule.Keen on art and music education being introduced to Indian children at a young age, she recounts how her own personal experience of these rich and diverse worlds opened doors of the mind and heart. ‘Art and music are antidotes to intolerance’ says Shubha, firmly endorsing the strong creative protests across the length and breadth of the country.Shubha Mudgal is a regular part of SAHMAT’s January 1 celebrations every year. She speaks of the transformative experience of performing there. SAHMAT was formed after the brutal killing of Safdar Hashmi twenty-six years ago. On January 1, 1989, 34 year old Safdar Hashmi, poet, playwright and political activist with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was beaten up by hoodlums belonging to the Congress party led by Mukesh Sharma while attempting to stage a play at Jhandapur in Sahibabad. He died from his injuries the next day. SAHMAT soon emerged as a strong artist and academic collective against the voices of authoritarianism and communalism.On February 27, 2012, Shubha Mudgal performed at Gulberg Society as part of the tenth memorial of the Gujarat genocide. Her stage was the roof of a house where 19 people were killed. Those that soaked up the renderings of Shubha, Aneesh Pradhan and Sudhir Patwardhan were over 1,000 survivors of the pogrom from all over Gujarat along with human rights defenders.She ends with the vocal rendering of Sahir Ludhianvi, “Aao koi khwaab bune kal ke waste…”This is a joint production of Communalism Combat, Newsclick and Hillele.org",art and music

Born in Salzburg, he showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court, but grew restless and traveled in search of a better position. While visiting Vienna in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in the capital, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, operas, and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the time of his death. He wrote more than 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most enduringly popular of classical composers, and his influence is profound on subsequent Western art music. Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart, and Joseph Haydn wrote: ""Posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years"".Thank you so much for watching this video by Halidon Music channel, we hope you enjoyed it!

    Composer Chat 03 - Art and Music - Limitation as Freedom
  ","I am discussing the concept of limitation in the context of artistic freedom. When I am faced with the whiteness of my creative page, I like to set limiting parameters before I begin my work. Choosing to limit my creative output can bring focus and direction. The following are a few examples of the concept of limitation:1. Georgia O'Keeffe uses soft and wavy curves in her paintings (example: Flower of Life II)2. Claude Debussy focuses on the pentatonic and the octatonic scales in his compositions.3. The game of chess limits the movements of the pieces both collectively and individually.Join me for more talks about art, inspiration, and all things creative.This episode features the music from my album Lacrimosa: http://www.dosiamckay.com/lacrimosa.s...My website: http://dosiamckay.com/My compositions: http://www.dosiamckay.com/recordings....My paintings: http://www.dosiamckay.com/art/gallery...My writing and poetry: https://musicwell.wordpress.com/Follow meFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dosiamckay/Twitter: https://twitter.com/dosiamckayGoogle+: https://plus.google.com/+DosiaMcKayYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/dosiamckay",art and music

Jan Hus, Emperor Rudolf II and Saint John of Nepomuk4.  Baroque splendour and extravagance5.  Alphonse Mucha and Czech Art NouveauPrague is one of the most beautiful cities of Europe and, uniquely, has remained largely unscathed by war for over three hundred years. Its fame rests upon a magnificent range of Baroque churches, palaces and public buildings embellished with art and sculpture from the eighteenth century. However, often overlooked, Prague also houses extraordinary examples of cultural works from a variety of other centuries, in particular the medieval period of the early fourteenth century and, at the other end of the time spectrum, the Art Nouveau movement.The lectures will highlight major developments in Prague’s history from its origins in the ninth century up to today, while considering representative examples of works from successive artistic periods. Throughout the lectures, relevant excerpts of Prague’s musical tradition – from religious chants and Hussite hymns to the compositions of the two towering figures of twentieth century Czech music, Smetana and Dvorak – will be introduced.http://www.summerschool.uct.ac.za/pra...DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed in the lecture are those of the lecturer and do not necessarily reflect those of the Summer School organisers.

    Abstract Art from Music
  ","Disclaimer: I am not an abstract painter. I was put in Abstract Painting as a random choice of the school my first semester. I prefer draw from observation:meaning realistic drawing. Project was to listen to some music and interpret colors and abstract forms from the music. I chose my friend Eli's song 'Ukulele Fun' that he put together one day when he decided to pick up the uke and cello (crazy talented musician)But as I see stories through music, this proved difficult; I don't see blobs, I see people and scenes.

    Music Karate —  New Style of Karate Martial Art Originated in Anjo | Toshin | TEDxAnjo
  ","Music Karate is a new style of karate that collaborates with music. It’s different from that of dance movements. Watch and enjoy the quick, technically sharpened, special movements that match with the melody, which are also slow and smooth. You’ll be amazed by their performance and your image of karate will be changed for sure.「ミュージック空手：安城生まれの新分野の空手」空手と音楽を融合させた新しい分野の空手。空手独特の切れのある動きから、音楽の曲想に合わせた柔らかい動きまで、ダンスとは一味違う演武をお楽しみください。空手の概念を根本から覆すほどの驚きと感動を味わうでしょう。経歴：ミュージック空手 (NPO法人 国際ミュージック空手連盟 闘真 )ミュージック空手は、空手の形を音楽に合わせてアレンジして演武をおこなう新たな空手の分野です。闘真会館発足６年目で初めてミュージック空手を一般に向けて披露して以来、安城発の新分野の空手を提案しています。現在では、社会貢献を目的に、ボランティアで空手の大会や学校行事、老人ホームの慰問、街のイベントなどで子どもたちが創作したミュージック空手を披露しています。また、国際親善を目的に海外との交流も行っています。現在４歳～大人まで幅広い年齢層の生徒が所属し、練習に励んでいます。ミュージック空手の作品を見た人々は感動するばかりでなく、空手の概念を根本から覆すほどの驚きをもつでしょう。ミュージック空手の素晴らしさをもっと多くの人々に知っていただくために、日々活動しています。Music Karate ( Toshin, NPO International Music Karate Association )Music Karate is a new style of karate, in which performers do karate with music. Since the introduction of the first performance in 1990, Toshin has been spreading this new field of karate from the City of Anjo. Currently, they perform at karate tournaments, school events, nursing homes and town events, as volunteers contributing to their society. The students create these music karate shows. Toshin is also involved with international exchange with their new brand of art. They have students ranging from the age 4, all the way to adult. You’ll be quite impressed by their wonderful performance and your image for karate will too, be changed by what they do on stage. They are continuously making effort in order to spread the magnificent beauty of their art.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

    How to be Creative - Developing Creativity - Art Music Writing etc.
  ","How to be Creative - Developing Creativity and Productivity - Art Music Writing etc.In this video, I talk about how to be creative and create better projects by using two different types of thinking. For creative insights, I recommend what I call creative mod. Then, when you actually create, you go into editing mode. But it's important not to mix up these two thought processes.Creativity and productivity are the two things needed to create a work of art. Many people spend forever in creative mode where new creative insights come up, but they never develop the productivity skills to bring those ideas to the world. On the other side, there are people who have created such a rigid system for creation that the editing related tasks completely nullify the ability for creative insights to come about. This process should work with many different art forms including but not limited to:DrawingPaintingSculptureWriting Video CreationAnimationDesignFilmMusicetc.",art and music

    Strange Interactive Art Installation of Musical Instrument Inventions - Music Box Roving Village
  ","When the Music Box Roving Village  is installed in a new location they change and add new instruments so when you see it it won't look the same or have the same instruments as you see in this documentary -  This documentary exhibits strange musical instruments invented by the New Orleans Airlift collaboration.  It's an amazing installation a village of portable sculpture dwellings that double as musical instruments.  The walls literally make music. Musicians famous and not so famous perform concerts and then the public is invited to jam on the creations. Any one young and old can play! Airlift programming highlights our city's underground art and under-the-radar artists, transporting the dynamic street culture, living folk culture and growing contemporary arts scene of New Orleans to far-flung locations around the world for exhibitions, workshops, festivals, performances, and collaborative projects.Airlift also brings influential artists from abroad to participate in collaborative endeavors with local artists in our own community. We believe that collaboration between artists and across communities shares resources, empowers learning and unites disparate groups in common and powerful goals.New Orleans Airlift is an artist-driven initiative that collaborates and creates alongside the artists and communities we support.Airlift was founded in 2008 by musician and artist manager Jay Pennington and Delaney Martin, a multi-media installation artist, as a response to the unparalleled destruction of Hurricane Katrina and its devastating aftermath which left local artists, like all New Orleanians, struggling for their lives and livelihoods.Jay and Delaney recognized a need for new audiences who could support these artists as they rebuilt their city. They dreamt up a one-time project that took city artists to Berlin and called it The New Orleans Airlift after the Berlin Airlift of WWII. Other exchange projects that used an import/export model and a multidisciplinary approach soon followed and the name stuck.New Orleans is the last great bastion of living folk culture in the United states. Airlift projects honor tradition alongside innovation, leading our artists, culture and communities in meaningful new directions.Tweet -  @dannywolverton https://twitter.com/dannywolvertonI invite you to follow me on facebook and twitter: http://www.facebook.com/realspecialheadhttps://twitter.com/dannywolverton http://www.specialhead.comhttp://www.facebook.com/wolvertondanny Special Head LevitationHe is  best known for his appearances on America’s Got Talent in 2013 /2014 and subsequent viral videos of his Levitation acts.

Thats a great reason to wake up in morning"" -Wolverton""My artistic Vision is greatly influenced by my upbringing in the Native American Peyote Way Church and the Baha'i Faith. I realized that  1,000 years ago all art, performance, music, and dance was done through spiritual inspiration. The original performances were ritual and Ceremony. It wasn't until the Renaissance  that making a living through art became more widespread. Through my performances I intend to bring us back to an age of mysticism. Reminding people that performance is a ritual and that magic can be spiritual. The Special Head show goes beyond a traditional magic show. Not only does Wolverton perform Music while simultaneously performing magic illusions, Wolverton also incorporates thought provoking theatrics into his many acts. Danny uses illusions to cause the viewer to question ""what it means to be human."" His show is flexible and can be adapted to entertain many different age groups.The Anarchestra is set up as an interactive art installation that the public gets to play. It can be tuned all to the same key making it hard to hit the wrong notes. You don't have to be a good musician to play it.

    A Symphony of Science, Music and Art | Ramya Mohan | TEDxRVCE
  ","Dr.Ramya Mohan brings together two elements which most people consider different, science and art. Music and art can be healing to the body and mind and she paints a beautiful picture for us showing how the two can come together in the form of the 'Creative Mind'. She strongly believes in the therapeutic power of music and uses it to aid recovery from illness. Dr. Ramya Mohan is a psychiatrist, artist, analyst, musician and an educator who is bridging the gap between neuroscience, mental health and creative arts to support brains better.

They were taught about what goes into each stage of filmmaking such as writing scripts, drawing storyboards, as well as scoring and editing the final products.

    Burning Man 2017: 70,000-strong expected to attend desert art and music festival - TomoNews
  ","BLACK ROCK DESERT, NEVADA — The Burning Man festival is here once again as hipsters from across the country start to litter the deserts of Nevada to play in the sand and use some dust. The no-holds-barred art and music festival parties on for nine straight days until September 4. About 70,000 people are expected to show up this year. Tickets are an ultra-affordable $1,200. Burning Manners also have to get to Black Rock Desert by themselves. Smoking Man is billed as a festival full of eclectic artists, off-the-wall families, high power CEO douches and tech dweebs. Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg have all partied it up at Hot Man before. Wouldn't you totally want to do some lines with these guys? The Smoldering Man was first held by Larry Harvey and some pals in 1986. It's called Burning Man because it started with some hippies chanting around a bonfire on the summer solstice on Baker Beach in San Fran. Since then, it's blown up into the spectacle you see now today. At the end of the festival, all the hipsters get together and burn a giant wooden man. It's so touching — especially if you're as high as a Space-X rocket.----------------------------------------­---------------------Go to https://www.patreon.com/tomonews and become a Patron now TomoNews is now on Patreon and we've got some cool perks for our hardcore fans.TomoNews is your best source for real news.

    Bjӧrk - Mutual Core - OFFICIAL - Art + Music - MOCAtv
  ","In ""Mutual Core,"" recorded by Björk for her seventh album Biophilia, the earth's geology is a metaphor for human relationships. Eruptions and earthquakes, the building of continents, the formation of mountain ranges and oceanic trenches: all are powerful signs of the earth's structure and mechanics. Represented musically by the violent interruption of block rocking beats, video director Andrew Thomas Huang here depicts the push and pull of tectonic plates with anthropomorphized rocks, lava and sand encircling Björk in dance, their psychedelic innards resembling the frayed strands of a Fritz Haeg rug.

    Teaching art or teaching to think like an artist? | Cindy Foley | TEDxColumbus
  ","What is the purpose and value of Art education in the 21st Century? Foley makes the case the Art’s critical value is to develop learners that think like Artists which means learners who are creative, curious, that seek questions, develop ideas, and play.  For that to happen society will need to stop the pervasive, problematic and cliché messaging that implies that creativity is somehow defined as artistic skill. This shift in perception will give educators the courage to teach for creativity, by focusing on three critical habits that artist employ, 1. Comfort with Ambiguity, 2. Idea Generation, and 3. Transdisciplinary Research. This change can make way for Center’s for Creativity in our schools and museums where ideas are king and curiosity reigns.Cindy Meyers Foley is the Executive Assistant Director and Director of Learning and Experience at the Columbus Museum of Art. Foley worked to reimagine the CMA as a 21st century institution that is transformative, active, and participatory. An institution that impacts the health and growth of the community by cultivating, celebrating and championing creativity. Foley envisioned and led the charge to open the 18,000 sq. ft. Center for Creativity in 2011. In 2013, the museum received the National Medal for Museums in recognition of this work. Foley guest edited and wrote chapters for Intentionality and the Twenty-First-Century Museum, for the summer 2014 Journal of Museum Education.In 2012, Foley received the Greater Columbus Arts Council Community Arts Partnership award for Arts Educator. She was a keynote speaker for the OAEA (Ohio Art Education Association) 2012 Conference. She is on the Faculty of Harvard University’s Future of Learning Summer Institute.Foley is a graduate of the University of Kentucky and The Ohio State University. Prior to joining the Museum, she was with the Institute of Contemporary Art at the Maine College of Art, the Portland Museum of Art, and the Wexner Center for the Arts.In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",art and music

Beginners, hobbyists and professionals.I started this show because I wanted to get back into making art and getting involved with the community here in Madison, WI. And what better way to do that than to find people and talk to them directly. I wanted to hear about how people create, promote themselves and in the meantime still manage their own well-being.I was originally going to be an animator but life and kids happened.I created a short-lived internet cartoon series called ""The Adventures of Xylus and Dexter"", where my two boys are superheroes in outer space, because why not?It gained mild popularity and it even landed me a chance to make an animated pilot for the series ""The Radio Adventures of Dr. Floyd"" by Grant Baciocco.But many years had passed since then and I decided to try and get involved in creating again. Problem was I didn't even know what the art community in my own city was like anymore. I decided I wanted to connect with them directly.And I even decided to try and see what it would be like to run my own business. So I rented out a 1930's train car to see what I could do with it!—Follow Me Online Here:Instagram: https://instagram.com/tmrayFacebook: https://facebook.com/americanbanditoFacebook Watch: https://www.facebook.com/americanband...Website: https://www.americanbandito.comTwitter: https://twitter.com/tmrayMedium: https://medium.com/@tmrayPodcast: https://www.americanbandito.com/podcastBand - Lorenzo's Music: https://www.lorenzosmusic.comOfficial Merchandise: https://amzn.to/2Ydj1lwJoin my list to keep up with everything that I'm doing here: https://mailchi.mp/americanbandito/ar...—",art and music

We started with the Great Wall of China (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCaH-...). As our tour of Brazil approached we set our sights on our next Wonder: Christ the Redeemer. This incredible piece of art soars 10 stories in the air, stretches 100 feet wide and weighs 1.4 million pounds (630,000 kg). But even more impressive is that it was built in the 1920's on a peak of a sheer 2,300 ft. (700 meters) cliff overlooking Rio de Janeiro. Not far from this inspiring statue are the Iguazu Falls on the border of Argentina and Brazil -- a natural Wonder of the World. Made up of 275 waterfalls that stretch across 1.7 miles (2.7 km), to match the amount of water that flows down these falls you would need 2 million people to each pour a quart of water every second. As we //consIdered\\ what piece of music would be worthy of such incomparable locations we looked to songs that have been composed or used to praise Jesus Christ, for whom the statue was built and who billions believe created all the natural wonders of this world. We wanted to combine the melody of the heartfelt hymn of praise ""How Great Thou Art"" with one of the most beautiful melodies ever written -- the theme from the movie ""The Mission"" (""Gabriel's Oboe."") ""The Mission"" is a movie that powerfully depicts the lives of men that lay down their lives for others. It was also filmed at Iguazu Falls. ""How Great Thou Art"" praises God and all that He has done for His children on this Earth. The two harmonize so beautifully with each other, both musically and thematically. As we played these pieces in front of the Christ Statue and Iguazu Falls we felt an overwhelming sense of wonder, peace, and joy.This music video is not meant to exclude anyone that does not believe in God. We hope that it instead promotes spiritual feelings that can be felt by all -- gratitude for a beautiful Earth, for life, and for joy.A wise man once said, ""If we thought of life as a gift, we might not demand nearly as much from it. And if we lived more graciously, giving of ourselves more freely to the well-being of others, many of our personal concerns would disappear, and life would become easier for all.""We respect all beliefs and opinions, but we hope that in the comments everyone can set aside religious differences and instead focus on building each other up -- through gratitude, inspiration, kindness and mutual respect. Thank you so much for watching! We are grateful for you!Credits""The Mission,"" also known as ""Gabriel's Oboe,"" (from the soundtrack of the movie ""The Mission"") written by Ennio Morricone""How Great Thou Art"" is a Christian Hymn based on a Swedish folk songArrangement produced by Jon SchmidtArrangement written by Al van der Beek, Jon Schmidt & Steven Sharp NelsonMixed & mastered by Al van der Beek at TPG Studios in UtahPerformed byJon Schmidt: PianoSteven Sharp Nelson: CellosVideo produced by Paul AndersonVideo filmed and edited by Shaye Scott & Paul AndersonChristina Perri - A Thousand Years (Piano/Cello Cover) - ThePianoGuys - https://youtu.be/QgaTQ5-XfMMLet It Go (Disney's ""Frozen"") Vivaldi's Winter - ThePianoGuys - https://youtu.be/6Dakd7EIgBEBeethoven's 5 Secrets - OneRepublic - ThePianoGuys - https://youtu.be/mJ_fkw5j-t0Titanium / Pavane (Piano/Cello Cover) - David Guetta / Faure - ThePianoGuys - https://youtu.be/fz4MzJTeL0cOne Direction - What Makes You Beautiful (5 Piano Guys, 1 piano) - ThePianoGuys - https://youtu.be/0VqTwnAuHwsColdplay - Paradise (Peponi) African Style (ft. guest artist, Alex Boye) - ThePianoGuys - https://youtu.be/Cgovv8jWETMAdele - Hello / Lacrimosa (Mozart) – ThePianoGuys - https://youtu.be/WZjFMj7OHTwStory of My Life (One Direction -- Piano/Cello Cover) - ThePianoGuys - https://youtu.be/yET4p-r2TI8This is Your Fight Song (Rachel Platten Scottish Cover) - ThePianoGuys - https://youtu.be/mOO5qRjVFLwDavid Guetta - Without You ft.

  ","An aid for meditation while praying the Rosary. The first Sorrowful Mystery is The Agony in the Garden. Just before he is betrayed by Judas and arrested to be crucified, Jesus prays in the Garden of Gethsemane. He struggles with the trial and suffering he knows he will soon face. Jesus' Agony In The Garden reassures you that you are not alone in your suffering.Mark 14:32-36""And he said to them, ‘My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch.’ And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. And he said, ‘Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee; remove this cup from me; yet not what I will, but what thou wilt.'""Luke 22:44-45""In His anguish He prayed with all the greater intensity, and His sweat became like drops of blood falling to the ground. Then He rose from prayer and came to His disciples, only to find them asleep, exhausted with grief.""Fruit of the Mystery: Sorrow for Sin",art and music

    Art, Music, and Faith | Alman Nusrat and Dr. Umar Faruq Abd-Allah
  ","From Alman's personal post on Facebook:""//Pleased to share this clip featuring the voice of Dr. Umar Faruq Abd-Allah, one of the leading scholars of North America and arguably from around the world. I’ve been involved with Art and Music my whole life and for years I questioned my role as an artist because I didn’t know how it related to my identity as a Muslim.Whilst in the Middle East, I happened to meet Dr. Umar and it was the first time a person of such intellectual caliber reassured me that art is a means of getting closer to God. And that my role as an artist actually mattered.My hope is that this message will now reach other artists seeking self-discovery and validation through faith. Together, we can rediscover beauty.""Alman Nusrat is a Singer-Songwriter of South Asian descent.

Jan Hus, Emperor Rudolf II and Saint John of Nepomuk4.  Baroque splendour and extravagance5.  Alphonse Mucha and Czech Art NouveauPrague is one of the most beautiful cities of Europe and, uniquely, has remained largely unscathed by war for over three hundred years. Its fame rests upon a magnificent range of Baroque churches, palaces and public buildings embellished with art and sculpture from the eighteenth century. However, often overlooked, Prague also houses extraordinary examples of cultural works from a variety of other centuries, in particular the medieval period of the early fourteenth century and, at the other end of the time spectrum, the Art Nouveau movement.The lectures will highlight major developments in Prague’s history from its origins in the ninth century up to today, while considering representative examples of works from successive artistic periods. Throughout the lectures, relevant excerpts of Prague’s musical tradition – from religious chants and Hussite hymns to the compositions of the two towering figures of twentieth century Czech music, Smetana and Dvorak – will be introduced.http://www.summerschool.uct.ac.za/pra...DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed in the lecture are those of the lecturer and do not necessarily reflect those of the Summer School organisers.

The spectacular fortress is located in the very heart of Poland, at the confluence of three rivers: the Vistula, the Narew and the Bug, in the immediate vicinity of picturesque sandy beaches hidden among forests and the phenomenal ruins of a historic granary. The Modlin Fortress is also over 200 years of turbulent history. The Poles, the French, Russians and Germans fought for this pearl of Napoleon and Tsar Nicholas I. After years of peace, in June 2018 Citadel will survive another siege, this time by the fans of electrifying sounds during the forthcoming INSTYTUT Festival :)More about location: Garnizon Modlin https://www.modlin.pl/Tickets: https://www.biletomat.pl/festiwale/in...More info:https://www.facebook.com/events/10865...Official merchandising: shop@technoinstytut.pl----22 i 23 czerwca 2018 w Twierdzy Modlin pod Warszawą zobaczymy się na trzech unikatowych scenach: MAIN, RAVE oraz UNDERGROUND w zupełnie nowej, niepowtarzalnej scenerii.

Twierdza Modlin to także ponad 200 lat burzliwej historii . O tę perłę Napoleona i Cara Mikołaja I walczyli Polacy, Francuzi, Rosjanie oraz Niemcy.

    Meditation: Holotropic Music, Art and Self Discovery.
  ","""Transpersonal and hallucinating"":  Holotropic Art:  Self Discovery through: Meditation, Zen, Art and Holotropic Music:  www.ediapostu.eu""Transpersonal Alert"" is an original track from the ""Transpersonal Alert"" album.-----------------------------------------------------------------------All contents © copyright 2013 Edi APOSTU (www.ediapostu.eu)------------------------------------------------------------------------Follower of Zen philosophy and fine connoissour of Chan philosophical systems, of Tibet Buddhism and of Hinduism, Edi APOSTU builds his pictorial space on the archetypal structures of the Macro-univesal Cosmogony, popularizes an original artistic vision in which he grasps an Imago Mundi which he transfers from the phylosophical conception into the pictorial or metaphorical image, his art being a nondiscursive metaphysics, a hermeneutics achieved  with the means which the fine art puts to the disposal of the signs.Edi APOSTU transforms the Implacable Time into an infinite Spiral of neverending illusions in which the mortal soul is anchored and takes different forms, from the perennial transmigration to which he is subjected to, due to the discontinuity of conscience among different existences, fact due to the ignorance of the Ego.In Edi APOSTU' s art there are found the primordial elements of Cosmos, symbols and Universal archetypes, signs reasoning with different plans of the Creation, either visible or invisible, either angelic or terrifying. As a whole, his works are images which find echo in other visible or invisible zones of Creation, portals towards parallel worlds.Being interested in the infinity of Time and in the Physical and Metaphysical space the artist, through harmonious joining of the flat forms with the 3D ones, decomposes temporary spaces in order to reconstruct them contortedly in non-temporal dimensions managing with magical skill to build unimaginable spaces and plans, revealing and offering to the spectator new visions on the infinite and perennial Creation.The themes come from the philosophical system of the artist, who, not agreeing with the idea of metempsychosis, considers that the transmigration of soul cannot only take place from one level to the other (the physical level -- the astral one and only on the Terrestrial level) but from one planetary system to the other, being possible that after death of the physical body the soul to rebirth in another physical body from another planet from the physical Universe, thus suggesting the concept of interplanetary transmigration.In a world in which culture, in general, as well as art, in particular, become more and more infantile with the passing of time, Edi APOSTU offers to the seekers of original and highly qualitative fine art a new vision in the field, proposing to the public the holotropic painting, a type of painting in which the complementary -- contrasting chromatics is chosen in such a way so to catch the eye of the spectator and to transpose it into states above the conscience.Edi APOSTU challenges the spectator to explore new dimensions, beyond time and space, his painting being an opening to new virtual and sensatory horizons.„The holotropic art is the art which is the result of  transpersonal experiences and which can transpose the beholder into states of overconsciousness.All my artistic creation, eiher painting, graphycs or poetry, is rich in symbols and universal archetypes. Even if most of my works are abstract, they transmit subtle messages and have as source of inspiration The Source, the Universal Source from which Information comes, information which materializes in the physical plan in my creations.I consider my artistic achievements as a stage in the process of both artistic self-perfection but especially in the spiritual one, because creating them I raised existential and metaphysical problems to myself and I think that the inspiration the artist receives while giving birth to a work of art can become an answer, because the artistic creation cannot have, in my opinion, a strictly human origin.Personally, I consider that the art is the most fascinating manifestation of the Divine creator at the terrestrial and physical level, through which there is made the connection between the limited-ephemeral human condition and the infinite-eternal Divine.""The name Holotropic means literally ""moving toward wholeness"" (from the Greek ""holos"" = whole and ""trepein"" = moving in the direction of something)",art and music

First add sand to the plate then begin playing a tone. Certain frequencies vibrate the metal plate in such a way that it creates areas where there is no vibration.

    Camille Paglia: Art and American Culture, Essays, History, Film, Music - Speech
  ","Camille Anna Paglia (English: /ˈpɑːliə/; born April 2, 1947) is an American academic and social critic. Paglia has been a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, since 1984.Paglia is critical of the influence modern French writers have had on the humanities, claiming that universities are in the ""thrall"" of French post-structuralists;[57] that in the works of Jean Baudrillard, Jacques Derrida, Jacques Lacan and Michel Foucault, she never once found a sentence that interested her;[58] and that post-structuralism has broken the link between the word and the thing, and thus endangers the Western canon.[59] François Cusset writes that Paglia, like other major American public intellectuals after World War II, owes her broader recognition mainly to the political repercussions of polemics that first erupted on college campuses, in her case to a polemic against foreign intellectualism. He says she achieved phenomenal success when she called Foucault a ""bastard"", thereby providing (together with Alan Sokal's Social Text parody) the best evidence for Paul de Man's view that theory should be defined negatively, based on the opposition it arouses.[60] However, Paglia's assessment of French writers is not purely negative. She has called Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex (1949) ""brilliant"", and identified Jean-Paul Sartre's work as part of a high period in literature. Paglia has praised Roland Barthes' Mythologies (1957) and Gilles Deleuze's Masochism: Coldness and Cruelty (1967), while finding both men's later work flawed. Of Gaston Bachelard, who influenced Paglia, she wrote ""[his] dignified yet fluid phenomenological descriptive method seemed to me ideal for art"", adding that he was ""the last modern French writer I took seriously"".https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille...Image By Fronteiras do Pensamento [CC BY-SA 2.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/...)], via Wikimedia Commons",art and music

  ","“We are being overwhelmed, in a good way, by the success of “Where Are Ü Now” with Justin Bieber, so with the video we wanted to just take it back to the beginning of the record & essentially create an ode to our fans.  Doing what we do, it’s entirely all about the fans.  We walk a fine line by being “famous” and in the public eye but we are only here because of you, the fans.  Justin wrote this record during a tough time in his life and it comes to us that sometimes, as artists, we are also just objects and we have to take that as much as we have to use that to create.

The amount of emotion that you could feel in the lyrics was crazy. As I listened to the song more and more it reminded me of so many things I’ve been through in my life. Toxic relationships, letting go of things I didn’t want to and just situations where happiness came with a sacrifice. Recently I lost my best friend, my companion, my life long friend. I wanted this video to embrace the pain that we feel losing or sacrificing something and the cycle of life that comes with it.

  ","NEW Mello™️ by Marshmello gear SHOP NOW ▶ https://mellogang.com/collections/new...Download Alone here ▶ http://smarturl.it/melloAlone A lot of people ask me where Alone and its lyrics comes from. Truth is, I had just moved away from my friends and family and I started to feel very home sick and lonely like I didn’t belong in my new settings. Everything was just happening so fast and I couldn’t really grasp where I was or who I was but all i knew was that I felt Alone. With the music video, we really wanted to send a message. Nobody knows how you feel, whether you’re homesick, away from friends and family, or if you simply aren’t like everyone else…its ok. The whole purpose of the Marshmello project and the Mellogang is to bring together people from every corner of the world and create a family…a family that we can all count on to never let us feel Alone. I hope you guys enjoy this video as much as I do.

    NASA | Thermonuclear Art – The Sun In Ultra-HD (4K)
  ","It’s always shining, always ablaze with light and energy that drive weather, biology and more. In addition to keeping life alive on Earth, the sun also sends out a constant flow of particles called the solar wind, and it occasionally erupts with giant clouds of solar material, called coronal mass ejections, or explosions of X-rays called solar flares. These events can rattle our space environment out to the very edges of our solar system. In space, NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, or SDO, keeps an eye on our nearest star 24/7. SDO captures images of the sun in 10 different wavelengths, each of which helps highlight a different temperature of solar material. In this video, we experience SDO images of the sun in unprecedented detail. Presented in ultra-high definition, the video presents the dance of the ultra-hot material on our life-giving star in extraordinary detail, offering an intimate view of the grand forces of the solar system.

    Street Food in Peru - ULTIMATE 14-HOUR PERUVIAN FOOD + Market Tour in Lima!
  ","😃Timour’s channel: https://youtu.be/8BnFdk2mW0c🎥Brazilian Street Food Tour: https://youtu.be/TlWDF3BfUdo👕T-shirts and caps: https://migrationology.com/store/Also, big thank you to Elias for showing us around Lima: https://www.instagram.com/acomer.pe/Street food in Lima, Peru! #Lima #Peru #PeruvianFood #streetfoodPeruvian food is one of the world’s great cuisines, and I was thrilled to have a chance to visit Peru to learn about and taste the food. In this video, get ready for an ultimate 14-hour straight Peruvian street food tour of Lima!Here’s everything included in this food tour:La Parada Market - If you love vegetable markets, I don’t think anywhere else in Lima is as colorful, energetic, and vibrant. This is the beating heart of Lima’s food supply, and I fully enjoyed walking around and seeing the diversity of ingredients from around Peru all in one busy wholesale Market.Caldo Cesar - Elias navigated us to Caldo Cesar, a restaurant that was incredibly packed and specializes in some of Lima’s best caldo de gallina - chicken hen soup. It was one of the best chicken soups I’ve ever had in my life. Total Price - 52 PEN ($15.71) for 4Ceviche Cart - One of the national dishes and most beloved dishes of Peru is ceviche (raw fish in lime juice), and we walked over to the section of the market where they sell fish and seasonings for ceviche and had a plate of fresh Peruvian ceviche. It was delicious. Price - 8 PEN ($2.42)Fruit Tasting - This was pretty unplanned, we just walked around the fruit market and tasted about a dozen types of fruit. My favorite fruits were the Sanky - Fruit produced by a cactus, Camu camu - Native to the Amazon rainforest, and Lucuma - Gold of the Incas.Papa rellena - This is one of the most common of all Peru street foods, a papa rellena, or a Peruvian stuffed potato. I was impressed - one of the best fried potatoes maybe I’ve ever had in my life.Tocosh - This fermented potato pulp, was invented by the Incas, and it’s not for the faint of heart. I thought it was unique and pretty delicious, and fun to eat, and it contains natural penicillin. Papa con huevo - This was ok, but just basic, a potato with egg on top and doused in sauces. This is again, a classic part of Peruvian street food, especially enjoyed by children.Sanguchería El Chinito - “I practically moved to Peru just for this sandwich.” - Timour Ghoneim. That says it all about this legendary chicharrón Peruvian sandwich located at Plaza de Armas. And he was right, you would move to Lima for this sandwich.Don Tito Pollos a la Brasa - If you ask Peruvians what is one of their comfort foods, I’m guessing pollo a la brasa would be a common answer. Pollo a la brasa is Pervuian rotisserie chicken, but somehow they just do it better in Peru. Total Price - 84 PEN ($25.39)Anticuchos Manuela - Without a doubt, this was one of my favorite parts of this entire Peru street food tour of Lima, anticuchos, or grilled cow hearts. They are truly majestic, so juicy and flavorful, you won’t believe it. Price - 10 PEN ($3.02)Picarones - Finally to end this ultimate street food in Peru tour of Lima, we ordered some picarones, donuts made from sweet potato and pumpkin. They are addictively delicious and should be eaten when you’re in Lima. Price - 6 PEN ($1.81) per boxGet more details about every restaurant including address and location on my Lima Guide: https://migrationology.com/travel-gui...Again, a huge thank you to Timour and Elias for showing us amazing street food in Peru:Subscribe to Timour: https://www.youtube.com/user/chefTimourFollow Elias: https://www.instagram.com/acomer.pe/🎵MUSIC: “Bailamos” “Te Quiero Verdad”https://www.audionetwork.com/——————————————————🍌Banana Chips are available now!!https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens👕Get t-shirts and caps:https://migrationology.com/store/📷Camera gear I use:https://kit.com/markwiens/camera-vide...——————————————————📱FOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",food

    Korean Street Food - NETFLIX SEOUL - I Ate Everything From the Episode! | Gwangjang Market!
  ","🎥King of KOREAN BBQ: https://youtu.be/IhFsN7qGWrM🍌Banana Chips available now!! https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens👕T-shirts: https://migrationology.com/store/Special thank you to Dan Gray, who took us on this Korean street food tour. You can follow him at https://www.instagram.com/seouleats/ and https://www.seouleats.com/ #KoreanFood #KoreanStreetFood #NetflixSTREET FOOD NETFLIX - Seoul, South KoreaI did enjoy watching the Street Food Netflix show, especially the amazing cinematography and the amazing stories of the people behind the food. However, there wasn’t much emphasis, if any, on the eating part of the street food. So I happen to be in Seoul for a few days, and I happen to know Dan Gray (https://www.instagram.com/seouleats/), who helped arrange the Seoul Street Food Netflix episode, and so he took us on the same tour, except this time, focused on eating everything.Here are the places covered in the Street Food Netflix, Korean street food in Seoul episode:Gwangjang Market - Most of the entire episode was filmed at the famous Gwangjang Market, a market I’ve been to many times, and is a must visit for Korean food lovers in Seoul.Yoonsun Cho - Gohyang Kalguksu Stall - Most of the Netflix Seoul episode was based around Yoonsun Cho and her incredible kalguksu, hand made knife cut noodles. They were very home-style tasting, very comforting and delicious. She also serves a number of other dishes including nangmyeon, and seaweed noodles, all of which were very good. Her sauce is also amazing, and her kimchi. Price - 5,000 KRW ($4.21) per bowlHonglim Banchan Stall - Probably the most delicious food on this entire Korean street food tour Netflix episode was the soy marinated crab from Honglim Banchan Stall. The crab was melt in your mouth and the marinade was perfect. Even better is when she scooped out some roe and mixed it with rice in the shell.Bindae-tteok stall - There’s an entire section of Korean street food dedicated to bindae-tteok at Gwangjang Market. Along with these crispy mung bean pancakes, we also ordered Yukhoe, Korean raw beef with egg and pear. Price - 30,000 KRW ($25.27) totalDongdaemun Food Street - Finally, the last thing in the Street Food Netflix episode of Seoul was the Baffle, a unique creation of rice made into a waffle, filled and topped with all sorts of interesting things. Price - 4,000 KRW ($3.37)It was a fun Korean street food tour, and we all had a great time eating and meeting the friendly vendors from the show.My friends in the video:Dan Gray (@seouleats): https://www.instagram.com/seouleats/ Jeffrey Merrihue (Heroic Deli LA @jeffrey_merrihue): https://www.instagram.com/jeffrey_mer...Rickmond (@rckmnd): https://www.instagram.com/rckmnd/🎵MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo📷CAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):• Main camera: https://amzn.to/2vY66aL• Main lens: https://amzn.to/2Qa08Ne• Microphone: https://amzn.to/2YoG6kO• Microphone fur: https://amzn.to/2LLDKuQ• Mini tripod: https://amzn.to/2YsJeMz• Drone: https://amzn.to/2Yvhib2📱FOLLOW:• Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology• Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology🍌Get Banana Chips now in US: https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens (more countries and more flavors coming soon)",food

    King of Ceviche - HUGE FLOUNDER Peruvian Food at Chez Wong in Lima, Peru!
  ","🎥Ultimate Peruvian Street Food Tour: https://youtu.be/Il3NjMlQ_dk😃Timour’s channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/chefTimour👕T-shirts and caps: https://migrationology.com/store/Mark Wiens Banana Chips - Available Now: https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiensCHEZ WONG - Known for his ceviche, and cooking stir fry with a massive, borderline dangerously huge flame, Chef Javier Wong is a legend of Peruvian food, especially Peruvian Chinese food. I first saw Chez Wong when Anthony Bourdain went there, and I knew it was a place I eventually wanted to go when I visited Peru. Today was that day! #Peru #Lima #PeruvianFood #ceviche1. Open hours: 1 pm - 3:30 pm (this is ceviche time in Peru)2. Reservations are a must, no walk-insPart of the reason to eat at Chez Wong when you’re in Lima is to experience the show of him cooking - he’s truly gifted and skilled at cooking and at performing. The highlight is him bringing a huge Peruvian sole (flounder, known as Lenguado in Spanish) out from the kitchen to prepare lunch for all the guests. You don’t know what you’ll get on his menu, and I think he used to make more dishes, but he’s making fewer dishes now. But you get whatever he makes for that day.Ceviche - You’re guaranteed to have a taste of Chez Wong’s legendary ceviche. What impressed me was its simplicity, fresh fish, lime juice, salt, and pepper, onions, and that’s it - but with some chilies on the side. The Leche de Tigre, or ceviche juice, is out of this world. I wouldn’t say it’s the best Peruvian ceviche you’ll eat in Lima, but it was one of the freshest and definitely the cleanest tasting ceviche I had during my trip. The fish was outstanding. I was hoping for tiradito as well, but I think he doesn’t make it anymore.Stir Fry - After ceviche, Chef Javier Wong sliced up more of the fish and added some ingredients like bok choy and mandarin to a metal mixing bowl. Then he went to the back to stir fry. His stir frying skills are next level master, genius. He cranks the fire so high, the flame reaches the ceiling before he even adds the food. The stir fry goes up in a flame of glory, infusing all the ingredients with the glorious breath of the wok. It’s truly beautiful to see him so calm with the fire. The stir fry was incredibly tasty, perfectly seasoned and balanced. And again, that fish was the highlight.Total price - 545 PEN ($164.38), for 4 adults. It’s not a cheap meal, but the fish is next level, it’s a once in a lifetime meal, and Chef Javier Wong truly is a special amazing man.Friends in the video:Timour’s videos: https://www.youtube.com/user/chefTimourJoel: https://www.instagram.com/kru_joel/🎵MUSIC: “Rabbid”https://www.audionetwork.com/——————————————————🍌Banana Chips are available now!!https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens👕Get t-shirts and caps:https://migrationology.com/store/📷Camera gear I use:https://kit.com/markwiens/camera-vide...——————————————————📱FOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",food

    Swedish Food in Stockholm: Melt-In-Your-Mouth Dill Cured Salmon!
  ","►Check out my Stockholm travel guide for food lovers: https://goo.gl/Duc1fB►Subscribe to my videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe►Camera I use: http://amzn.to/2dEL3hvDay 18: Stockholm, Sweden - This was a Stockholm food tour day. We started by visiting a couple of well known Swedish food halls, and then ate some more delicious Swedish food. It was an amazing day of visiting Stockholm!00:25 Swedish breakfast at Courtyard Marriott - The Courtyard Marriott hotel in Stockholm had an impressive display of breakfast foods including plenty of Swedish food in the buffet as well. So we started off the day with breakfast at our hotel before starting off.5:03 Hötorgshallen Food Hall - After walking around Stockholm for a while and fully enjoying the views of the city and the water, we made our way over to Hötorgshallen Food Hall, one of the Swedish food destinations on this Stockholm food tour day. After contemplating what to eat for a while, I settled on eating at a place called Melanders Fisk that specializes in seafood. Ying had the poached salmon and I had a the dill cured salmon (gravad lax). It was impressively good, the salmon was melt in your mouth tender and it was served with a side of potatoes as well. I also had toast skagen which are shrimp over toast. It’s one of my favorite Swedish foods. Total price - 370 SEK ($43.32)12:32 Östermalmshallen Food Hall - Another legendary food hall in Stockholm is the gourmet Östermalmshallen Food Hall. It’s been around since 1888, but they’ve been doing renovation on the original market for the last couple years, so it’s a temporary market for now. The market has a lot of similar restaurants and gourmet food stalls as Hötorgshallen, and there’s no shortage of amazing looking food. After walking around for a while, since we had just eaten, I chose to buy some moose sausage, which was pretty good.15:49 Östermalms Korvspecialist - Next stop on this Stockholm food tour is Östermalms Korvspecialist which is just a short walk from Östermalmshallen Food Hall and they specializes in marevelous sausages. I ordered the kabanoss, a spicy sausage filled into a baguette and seasoned with mustard and sauerkraut. It was a truly delicious sausage, I loved it. Kabanoss - 60 SEK ($7.02)18:36 Gamla Stan - Gamla Stan is Old Stockholm and it’s filled with narrow medieval lanes, shops and restaurants, and it’s just a great place to walk around and explore. We stopped at the German Church and I just enjoyed the atmosphere and just walking around on foot.21:44 Nystekt Strömming - When I asked you where to eat in Stockholm, one of the top places I was recommended over and over was Nystekt Strömming, a food stall that specializes in serving Baltic herries. They serve fresh herring, not the notorious Swedish fermented herring. I ordered strömming on rye which came with deep fried herring, mustard, onions, and dill on top. It was awesomely delicious. By this time on this Stockholm food tour day I was getting pretty full. Strömming - 40 SEK ($4.68)So we ended the day here. It was a wonderful day in Stockholm eating lots of delicious food!Disclaimer and Thank You: Thank you to Star Alliance and their Round The World tickets (http://www.staralliance.com/en/round-...) for sponsoring my business class flights.

It’s a beautiful market and any lover would enjoy walking around this amazing market.Miran - Pastourma and Soutzouki - This is a really cool little deli in Athens where you can buy for takeaway or order whatever you see and sit at one of the tables to snack. They are known for their camel pastirma, and it was the best thing we tried - absolutely excellent.Total price - 4.62 EURBougatsopoleio Thessaloniki - Bougatsa is a famous Greek food pastry. We tried a couple versions, but the best for me was the minced meat filled bougatsa. Total price -  15.50 EURKostas Soulvaki - Souvlaki, also known as kalamaki is perhaps the best known of all Greek street food or Greek fast food, and Kostas is considered to be one of the best places to eat it in Athens. They grill pork, stuff it into Greek pita, top it with tomatoes, onions, and tomato sauce, and wrap it into a handheld treat. Amazing.Price - 2.20 EUR per pieceTaverna To Trigono - For dinner, Tassos wanted to take us to one of his favorite restaurants in Athens, a little outside of the city in a place called Kalyvia Thorikou. This is a countryside meat paradise, and they served us some of the best lamb chops I’ve ever had in my life. An amazing  meal to end an incredible day of Greek food in Athens.Lamb chops Total price for everything - 99 EURThank you for watching this Greek food tour of Athens!MUSIC: Opas Dance, Love Every Moment: https://www.audionetwork.com/***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2wXXT8hMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zGorillapod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkII would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/",food

    Non-Veg INDIAN Street Food HEAVEN in Bhatiyar Gali | Ahmedabad, India
  ","I can’t overstate how much I fell in love with India during the six weeks I spent there in 2018. The three weeks I spent in the country in February of that year was a wonderful introduction to Indian culture and cuisine, and the 18 days I spent touring even more cities in November was a beautiful, immersive experience where I dove even deeper into this gorgeous country’s rich history, fascinating culture, and divine cuisine. I’m so glad I got to take that lifechanging trip with my good travel buddy Sam from Samuel & Audrey! Subscribe to Samuel & Audrey: https://www.youtube.com/user/Backpack...Follow Rutu on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/youeatmeins... On our second night in Ahmedabad, our new friend Rutu and her brother Haardm took us on an incredible non-veg, nighttime street food tour of the Bhatiyar Gali area of the city that blew our minds! This place is noisy and chaotic, but I love it! Come along with us as we explore the world of non-veg Gujarati street food! Subscribe & Click the Bell for 2+ Videos Per Week ► http://bit.ly/DBH-SUB My Film Making Kit ► https://kit.com/davidsbeenhereWhile 95% of the residents of the state of Gujarat are vegetarians, there are still places in Ahmedabad that cater to the non-veg crowd there, and the street known as Bhatiyar Gali is one of them. There, you’ll find cooks and vendors butchering animals and serving them up right on the street! I couldn’t wait to start eating!We began our food tour at ZK Fry Centre, where we got two chicken dishes (chicken pesto and chicken fry) and two mutton dishes (mutton masala and mutton chaap) along with some rotis and raw onions. I started with the mutton chaap, which was tender and contained lots of spices, and was bathed in a rich and flavorful sauce. I had to eat around the bone, though. It wasn’t hot, but the amount of spices made my lips tingle! Next was the chicken pesto, which looked similar to butter chicken. This dish was hot, and I could taste lots of onion and coriander. It was delicious, like butter chicken on steroids! Next, I went with the mutton masala. It was really good, and had a rich and oily gravy, but contained small bones that I had to be careful of. Then it was time for the chicken fry, which was fantastically spiced and tasted like rotisserie chicken! Then it was Sam’s turn to try the chicken pesto!As we left ZK Fry Centre, I watched a guy kill and butcher a chicken right in front of me! One of the things about Bhatiyar Gali is that the food here is extremely fresh. It’s literally as fresh as you can get!Our next stop was Akbari Hotel, where we got some mutton leg, a few chicken dishes (one in white gravy, some chicken tandoori, and Chicken Hyderabadi) and some prawns with chilies! I started with the prawns, which came in a rich sauce and had so many different flavors that hit me all at once! It was slightly spicy and so amazing! The mutton leg was almost pure fat and I had to suck the marrow out of the bone. The boneless chicken in the white gravy was incredibly tender and the gravy reminded me of a light white wine sauce. The Chicken Hyderabadi was cooked in green chilies and wasn’t hot at first, but the heat intensifies over time. The chicken itself was nice and juicy. And the tandoori chicken had some burnt edges and had a really nice, roasted flavor. I couldn’t taste the curd, but it was still the best chicken leg I’ve ever had in my life! Then Sam tried the tandoori chicken. The prawns were the star of the night for me, followed by the chicken pesto!We wrapped up our night with some sweet paan, which contained some fruit, marmalade, and caramel. It was a nice palette cleanser, but was way too much to chew, so Sam and I actually had to spit some of it out!What an amazing night!

We started “travel hacking” and taking more trips together and finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and travel hacking over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling. So we extended our 1 year trip to THREE years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before Nate turns 30 (which is March 20, 2019)! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",food

We we watched how the men of the tribe sometimes prepare and roast a whole goat. This usually occurs when the Maasai men spend the night out in the plains after roaming far from home to graze the livestock. Per tradition, they don’t eat in front of women. They however take back certain pieces for the women, once they are done feasting. This bonding time with the Maasai men is said to build fraternity. 🇰🇪 RAW BLOOD AND KIDNEY: The goat is slaughtered and the blood is collected in a sufuria. This is drank fresh. Cuts like the kidney are also eaten raw. 🇰🇪 GOAT ROAST: The legs are skewered on makeshift spears, and are roasted upright around a central fire.

    TOP 5 BEST THAI DISHES! | My Favorite Thai Food in Bangkok, Thailand!
  ","Huge thank you to Greg from Travizeo https://goo.gl/VhaLp5 for filming and making this video!Subscribe now: https://goo.gl/6zXZGK for 2 new videos every week.A totally different style video today, hope you enjoy it!One of the most common questions I get asked is Mark, “what are your favorite Thai foods?” And so when Greg was in Bangkok I thought it would be an awesome idea to cover when he was filming with his amazing video skills.By the way, Greg films cinematic travel videos for brands and promotions, and he also happens to love to eat! Go check out his videos (https://goo.gl/VhaLp5) and website for more details (http://travizeo.com/). And I was very excited when he offered to film and edit a video for me.Choosing my favorite Thai dishes is a very hard thing to do, but I narrowed it down.1. Braised beef fire pot (เกาเหลาเนื้อหม้อไฟ) at Heng Chun Seng (ร้าน เฮ้งชุนเส็ง) - There’s just about nothing better to eat for breakfast in Bangkok, and after trying quite a few versions, Heng Chun Seng is still my favorite. The beef is tender and most of all the soup is so fragrant from the herbs and beef. Google map: https://goo.gl/maps/yhtoLCyUbVy2. Holy basil stir fry (กระเพราหมูสับ) at Ung Jia Huad (ร้านอึ้งเจี่ยฮวด) - If there’s one dish that could be the most popular and beloved easy to eat Thai food, it’s holy basil stir fry (with your choice of meat). It’s a dish that always hits the spot. Google map: https://goo.gl/maps/q6apJqZEhUH23. Green papaya salad (ตำปูปลาร้า) Stall on Sukhumvit - You’ll find green papaya salad on just about every street corning in Bangkok and throughout Thailand. My favorite version is som tam boo plaraa, dressed with fermented fish sauce.4. Fish viscera curry (แกงไตปลา) at Janhom (ร้านจันทร์หอม) - Southern Thai food is always a favorite of mine, and gaeng tai pla, or a curry made with fish viscera is one of the most flavorful Thai foods of them all. Google map: https://goo.gl/maps/kC9a62QCApD25. Jungle curry (แกงป่า) at Pla Mae Nam (ร้านปลาแม่น้ำ) - A dish I just can’t get over, and have to order every chance I have, is Thai jungle curry. It’s an amazing mixture of chilies and herbs, and in this case, fish. This is also one of my favorite restaurants in Bangkok at the moment as well. Google map: https://goo.gl/maps/4kbcuqoVdPP2There it is, 5 of my favorite dishes in Thailand. Thank you for watching this video!Again, huge thank you to Greg from Travizeo https://goo.gl/VhaLp5 for filming and editing this entire video!MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdoCAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzFOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyThank you for watching!",food

All our stallholders are committed to providing food that bursts with fresh, vibrant flavours, inspired by cuisines from Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. No wonder SCFood Market is one of London’s top food destinations.You can find the market on Southbank Centre Square each weekend including bank holidays and for an extended market at the end of summer.What’s to eat?Perfectly grilled corn-on-the-cob, the best moong dal dosas in town, Korean burritos, vegan Ethiopian, craft beers, interesting cocktails, cake, ice cream, great coffee... in other words, LOADS!  Bread Tree make bruschetta the way families in Italy have done for centuries, no short cuts. They use bread made in a small bakery in Sicily, and offer vegan and wheat-free options too! Seasonings and toppings are all sourced in Calabria, such as pickled aubergines, sundried tomatoes, pesto Calabrese, sundried tomato paste and nduja.Also on the menu are piadina, the delicious Italian flatbread sandwich. Go for the traditional parma ham or check out one of the veggie or vegan options, all served with sauces that come from southern Italy.Cristian’s family is originally from Calabria, where his grandfather was a producer of wine and olive oil. Rebecca, originally from Taiwan, also comes from a country where people are very passionate about great food, and she has contributed to Bread Tree her dedication to healthy ingredients.  Tea, Bread & Brownie brings a wide selection of teas, real Belgian hot chocolate and chai latte to serve at the market, as well as retail teas to take home and brew.Also check out their range of Flour Station sourdough breads, pastries and sweet and savoury treats including cheese straws, savoury muffins, brownies, cream teas, and more, all of which have been freshly baked.As well as buying teas to take home, you can enjoy a hot cup of tea to go.

Sample traditionally madepork smoked sausages served with salad and pickles in a baguette, or with roasted baby potatoes, cured meats, Polish draught beer and, in winter, sauerkraut stew, made with smoked pork sausage.  When Will and Kerry hand you your gourmet burger, you’re getting it from the hands of the same people who raised the cows and grew the wheat and grass they feasted on. The beef is hung on the bone for three weeks, then they seam cut the beef (a continental style of butchery which cuts around the muscles rather than slicing straight through them). They bind the burgers with their own free range eggs. And if that is not enough for you, pop a couple of their steaks in your bag to take home.",food

    Extreme Chinese Street Food - JACUZZI CHICKEN and Market Tour in Kunming! | Yunnan, China Day 4
  ","This Day 4 of this 4-part video Chinese food tour of Yunnan. Watch it all here: https://goo.gl/QhiJUb►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe►T-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Thanks to Frank and Jerry of Zouba Tours: http://www.zoubatours.com/ for taking me around. I paid for this tour, but they did a great job and I would recommend them.Kunming, Yunnan, China - Kunming is the capital and largest city in Yunnan province China. So I was excited to explore the local market in Kunming and eat as much street food as possible!Here are all the Chinese street food dishes we ate throughout the market:Rice pudding - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was slightly fermented, and sweet, like a rice alcohol pudding. It was pretty good, but quite sweet, so I couldn’t eat that much of it.Dumpling - 1 RMB ($0.15) - I saw these dumplings sizzling and hissing and there was no way I could walk by without trying one. Stuffed inside were leek and egg. They were a little on the oily side, but delicious.Whole duck - 20 RMB ($3.03) - Yunnan is famous for roast duck, and there’s a version that’s comparable even to Beijing style. Style I was excited to find a stall that at the market that specialize in Yunnanese roast duck. It was delicious and the owners were very friendly as well.Pickled pears - 5 RMB ($0.76) - This was an interesting snack, and supposed to be very healthy and good for digestion. Drink - 2 RMB ($0.30) - This drink was incredible sweet, but refreshing.Tofu Noodles - 5.5 RMB ($0.83) - Another extremely popular Chinese street food snack at the market was tofu noodles - I’ve had tofu and noodles, but not really mixed before. It was a little plain and starchy, but from all the sauces, it was taty.Rice balls - 5 RMB ($0.76) - We also tried sesame rice balls which were delicious.Jacuzzi braised ½ chicken - 15 RMB ($2.27) - This was one of the highlights of the market for me, mainly because the owner was so friendly and his giant jacuzzi of boiling chickens was amazing to see! The chicken was a little bony, but flavorful.Yellow soybean porridge - 3.5 RMB ($0.53) - As we were leaving the market, we stopped for one last bowl of soybean porridge to eat with youtiau, Chinese donuts. I wasn’t expecting to like it as much as I did, but it was delicious. It was very warming and hearty.Finally to complete this Chinese street food tour in Kunming, Jerry and I, along with his family ate Chinese Yunnanese bbq. It was tasty and a great way to end this amazing day of street food.Special thanks to Zouba Tours (http://www.zoubatours.com/) for arranging everything in this video. I paid for this tour, but I think they did a great job, and I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the tour.That completes Day 4 of this Chinese food tour of Yunnan.

    Street Food in Uzbekistan - 1,500 KG. of RICE PLOV (Pilau) + Market Tour in Tashkent!
  ","►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe►T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Thank you to B. Hamzaev - Head of Marketing and Promotion of Uzbekistan Tourism. Check out Bekruz: https://goo.gl/M14aZWRavshan’s Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLf...Uzbekistan Day 1: TashkentOn Day 1 in Uzbekistan we went on an ultimate Uzbek street food tour in Tashkent, including the biggest bazaar in the city, and the most massive plov (rice pilau) cooking in Tashkent.We had arrived at the airport in Tashkent at about 4 am in the morning, and at 9 am we were ready to start eating our way through the city. First we met up with Bekruz and Akbar both from the Ministry of Tourism Uzbekistan (Bekruz is the one who invited me to Uzbekistan and arranged everything for us, so thank you Bekruz!), and Ravshan (check out his channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClLf...), a local food vlogger in Uzbekistan.Two of the most important phrases you should know in Uzbek are:Assalomu Alaykum - Hello / GreetingRahmat - Thank youBread Bazaar, Tashkent - We started this ultimate street food tour at the bread bazaar in Tashkent, a market dedicated fully to bread, with a little fruit and other things mixed in. We bought some break, some kaymak, and some fruit and then went to a nearby restaurant where they laid everything on the table for us, along with tea. Uzbek breakfast was a great way to get started.Chorsu Bazaar - The grandest bazaar in Tashkent is Chorus Bazaar, and it’s a perfect place to get a feel of Uzbek culture and food. We first stopped at the food court to try hanum, a type of dumpling filled with potato and somsa. Then we continued to the dome shaped iconic part of the bazaar, filled with fresh meat and spices. It’s one of the coolest market structures anywhere in the world.Plov Center - We kind of had to rush out of Chorsu Bazaar because although they prepare 1,500 Kilos, seriously, of rice plov per day, it only takes 2 - 3 hours before they run out everyday. So we got there, already one of the monster swimming pool pans was finished, but they still had a few others going and serving. Plov is the national dish of Uzbekistan, a food that’s eaten on every and all occasions. For Tashkent plov, it’s pretty heavy on the meat at oil, with rice, chickpeas, and raisins. Also it included, qazi - horsemeat sausage which is a delicacy. It was incredibly delicious, and proper meal experience.Total price - 100,000 UZS ($12.21)Plov is love, remember that when you’re in Uzbekistan.National Food Restaurant - After strolling around for a while in the afternoon, we continued to a National Food restaurant, a laid back family style restaurant that serves all things Uzbek food. Along with a number of dishes, the main dish I was most interested in was the naryn, thin slices of dough mixed with minced meat and horse. It was interesting, and quite good, as were the other dishes.Total price - 110,000 UZS ($13.43)Sultan Suleyman Restaurant - For dinner we went to a bit of a fancy trendy restaurant, and had another platter of food. This time, dough noodle like sheets topped with meat, horse sausage again, and green onions.Total price - 122,000 UZS ($14.90)It was a day of learning, eating, and meeting some amazing people along the way. Thank you for watching this Uzbekistan food tour!MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",food

    Unprocessed -- how I gave up processed foods (and why it matters) | Megan Kimble | TEDxTucsonSalon
  ","This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. n January of 2012, Megan Kimble was a city-dwelling 26-year-old—busy and broke, living in a small apartment without so much as a garden plot to her name. But she cared about food: where it came from, how it was made, and what it did to her body. So she set herself a challenge: She would go an entire year without eating processed foods. In this talk, she discusses what makes a food processed and how those processes impact our bodies and communities.Megan Kimble is the managing editor of Edible Baja Arizona, a local food magazine serving Tucson and the borderlands, and is a regular contributor to the Los Angeles Times. Her book, Unprocessed, about her year of eating only whole, unprocessed food, is forthcoming from William Morrow in 2015. Follow along at megankimble.com. About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",food

    23 AWESOME FRUIT HACKS YOU SHOULD TRY || EASY FOOD IDEAS AND TASTY RECIPES
  ","SUPER-EASY MANGO RECIPESI have never seen a person who doesn’t love mango as they taste so good! Besides, this fruit has a lot of benefits for your health! Eating mangoes will help you to boost immunity, it clears the skin,  improves eye health and improves digestion. Usually, we have two problems: it’s really impossible to stop eating mangoes as they are truly delicious and the second problem is that everything becomes sticky around you and you also. In this video, we share a lot of lifehacks how to choose mango, the quickest way to peel and cut it and cool recipes with mango that you will love!The first trick will teach you how to choose mango: pour water in a bowl and place mangoes inside. The ripe one doesn't sink. Always wash mango before cutting it. Mangoes have a large and flat pit in the middle and you need to make two slices on either side of the pit. Now you have two halves with flesh, use the knife to make squares as we show in our tutorial. Next, take a glass and place the edge of the mango half against the lip of a glass and slide it down. Because the mango flesh is very soft, the glass can slide through it and separate the skin relatively pain-free. We prepared a perfect one ingredient dessert that will be a perfect snack for healthy eaters or kids. Besides it a perfect vegan and gluten-free dish. Preheat oven to 155 Degrees F. Mango roll-ups are very easy to cook: make mango puree, take a baking tray, cover it with a cookie sheet and spread evenly mango puree with a spatula. Bake for 7 hours. Enjoy! One more cool recipe is mango sorbet made from frozen mangoes. You will love this quick and low-calorie recipe. You can also make beautiful mango roses covered with chocolate syrup. This desserts looks gorgeous and is also super-delicious!

    Village Food in East Africa - FREE-RANGE KFC (Kenya FRIED CHICKEN) Kenyan Food in Machakos!
  ","►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe►T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/I met up with my friend Bramuel who took us to his farm and house (in the process of being built) in Machakos, Kenya. It was about a 2 hour drive to get there, but along the way we first stopped in Machakos town to eat, and then continued on to the farm. At the farm, we were treated to a fresh chicken and rabbit from the farm, and they cooked both dry and wet fry - classic Kenyan meat preparation. Also, the sukuma wiki was excellent.Machakos, Kenya - TTOT Hotel - So first, along the way in this village food tour of Kenya, we stopped in Machakos. The mix of green maize and peas and delicious, along with beef stew. The beef stew was especially good with a sprinkle of lemon juice and pili pili (chili).Total price - 3,000 KES ($29.61) for allWe arrived to Bramuel’s house in the countryside, way off the beaten path. And they immediately got started on our meal. They butched the chicken and rabbit, and we saw the entire process from start to finish of the meal. Along with dry fried chicken and rabbit wet fry, we also had a big pot of sukuma wiki, one of the best and most commonly eaten vegetables in Kenyan food, and ugali (ugali is made from maize meal, and is one of the most commonly eaten starches in Kenya). Everything was delicious, and I especially enjoyed the kachumbari, which was like Kenyan guacamole, to eat with all the meat.Thank you to everyone who cooked and helped in this video, and thank you to Braumuel for inviting us over to his home.Thank you for watching!MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo***CAMERA GEAR*** I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):Main camera: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2EjBeEgMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zDrone: http://amzn.to/2CrtAHzI would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",food

    Street Food in Ghana - GIANT CHOP-BAR LUNCH and West African Food Tour in Accra!
  ","This was an incredible day of street food in Ghana!►Check out Jay: https://www.instagram.com/mukasechic/►SUBSCRIBE for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe►T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Jay (Mukase Chic) is an amazing woman, so positive and talented, and so much fun to hang out with and eat with! She’s a food personality, a chef, a restauranteur, a blogger - she’s incredible. Check out her Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/mukasechic/) and YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8y8...). Anyway, so Jay took me an ultimate street food tour in Accra, here’s all the amazing food we ate:Red red (bean stew) and plantain - This was the first stop, a small stall that Jay has been eating at for years. They fry plantain, and then serve the plantain along with beans stewed in palm nut oil, and combine it with gari, which are cassava flakes. The result, is a filling and very satisfying combination of sweet and tangy plantains with salty oily beans. What’s key as Jay explained to me is the palm nut oil, which provides so much oil and fragrance. It was delicious, and a perfect way to begin this Ghanaian street food tour in Accra!Total price - 4 GHC ($0.90)Nima Market - Next we caught a taxi to Nima Market, known for its spices. We tried everything we could find, which was quite a lot of snacks here and there. The market was fantastic to walk around, full of action and energy.Coconut toffeeTigernuts - 1 GHC ($0.20)Masa - 1 GHC ($0.20)Zowey (adaakwa) - 1 GHC ($0.20)Kulikuli - 1 GHC ($0.20)Boiled egg - 1 GHC ($0.20)Fried cheese - 1 GHC ($0.20)Burkina - 3 GHC ($0.70)Bofrot - 1 GHC ($0.20)Peace Chop Bar (Chop Bar - Local Ghanaian restaurant) - Finally, to end this street food tour of Ghana in Accra, we stopped back at the chop bar that we had visited earlier in the morning. Seeing the cooking was sensational, it only made me hungrier for lunch. By the time we arrived back, they had already sold out of a few dishes, but there was still plenty enough to choose from. I tried the banku with goat meat, and it was fantastic.Total price - 36 GHC ($7.90)This was an incredible day of eating street food in Accra.

    North Korean Food in Seoul - RAINBOW NOODLES + Big Beef Hot Pot in South Korea! (ft. Miss Mina)
  ","🎥Go check out Mina’s Channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/sweetand...🍌Banana Chips available now!! https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens👕T-shirts: https://migrationology.com/store/SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - In this food tour, Mina and I discovered authentic North Korean food in Seoul. Seoul is only 50 km from North Korea, and home to many North Koreans, some of whom have opened restaurants in the city. I’ve been to Seoul many times, but never had any like these unique North Korean dishes before. Naengmyeon is known to be one of the most common North Korean foods, but we wanted to try a few other lesser known North Korean dishes as well.Here are the North Korean restaurants we ate at on this food tour:Dongmu Bapsang (동무밥상) - This is where you can order the giant platter of rainbow noodles, and I would strongly recommend it. They pour the soup tableside, and it’s such a refreshing dish. Additionally the Sundae, Korean blood sausage, was some of the best I’ve ever had. Total price - 61,000 KRW ($51.63)Hadan (하단) - Situated just off the main road in an unassuming small house like building Hadan (하단) specializes mostly in North Korean bowls of noodles and mandu dumplings. The food was very good, tasted handmade, and the restaurant feels very homely. The owner really warmed up to us, and as we left, even insisted that we take umbrellas. Total price - 44,000 KRW ($34.70)Jinmi Pyongyang Naengmyeon (진미평양냉면) - Finally, the third restaurant on this North Korean food tour of Seoul, we went to Jinmi Pyongyang Naengmyeon (진미평양냉면) to eat Naengmyeon noodles, and this massive pan of beef hot pot with herbs. Total price - 104,000 KRW ($88.03) Overall, North Korean food seems very pure, some things with less flavor, a little more plain, yet still flavorful and focusing on the natural ingredients without extras. Taking this North Korean food tour of Seoul was a fun experience, especially hanging out and eating with Mina.Go check out Mina’s Channel (Miss Mina): https://www.youtube.com/user/sweetand... and https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8hI...🎵MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdo📷CAMERA GEAR I used to make this video (these are affiliate links):• Main camera: https://amzn.to/2vY66aL• Main lens: https://amzn.to/2Qa08Ne• Microphone: https://amzn.to/2YoG6kO• Microphone fur: https://amzn.to/2LLDKuQ• Mini tripod: https://amzn.to/2YsJeMz• Drone: https://amzn.to/2Yvhib2📱FOLLOW:• Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationology• Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology🎥Watch all my Brazilian food videos: https://youtu.be/TlWDF3BfUdo🍌Get Banana Chips now in US: https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens (more countries and more flavors coming soon)",food

It’s a market where you’ll find everything and anything - from a fresh wet market to shoes and cosmetics, all open air, and under the Ueno railroad tracks. It also happens to be a great place to sample some budget Japanese street food in Tokyo.Here’s what I ate on this tour of Ameya-Yokochō Market:Chirashi don - sashimi rice bowl, quality is not the best, but it is quite budgetTotal price - 1,750 JPY ($15.92) for 2Oyama Meat Pie - this is a little gem, it’s like a little deep fried meat patty - so greasy and so good.Price - 200 JPY ($1.82)Izakaya Hamachan - Throughout the market you’ll find plenty of little izakaya’s, Japanese pubs, where you can grab a drink and some food. They are great places to hang out when you’re exploring the food at the market.Total price - 2,743 JPY ($24.96)Taiyaki and ice cream - These are two of the most popular Japanese street food sweet snacks. The taiyaki wasn’t the best I’ve had, but the ice cream was quite nice.Price -  450 JPY ($4.09)Jumbo Kebab - Believe it or not, doner kebabs are actually one of the most popular street foods to eat at Ameya-Yokochō Market, and I saw mostly Japanese people eating doner kebabs. I ordered the super spicy hot sauce with my doner, and it was just the perfect spicy ending to this street food tour!Price - 500 JPY ($4.55)-MUSIC in This Video: Can You Catch Me - https://goo.gl/HwVjdoCAMERA GEAR used to make this video (these are affiliate links):GH5: http://amzn.to/2sV0XQOMain lens: http://amzn.to/2szLZNf2nd lens: http://amzn.to/2mcEGauMicrophone: http://amzn.to/2rBKD3zTripod: http://amzn.to/2rBFkkII would love to connect with you!Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationologyT-shirts available now: https://migrationology.com/store/Thank you for watching!",food

  ","It can be hard to stick to a diet in modern times when eating out. It was much the same for a medieval knight, so when he was dining in his own household his personal physician would work with his cook to keep their master in peak condition. In this episode, Jason and food historian Chris Carr discuss the medieval understanding of nutrition and how it affected the knight’s diet, as well as the influence of spices and how they defined one’s social standing.• Executive Producer: Jason Kingsley OBE• Executive Producer: Chris Kingsley• Senior Producer: Brian Jenkins• Producer: Edward Linley• Director: Dominic Read• Presenter: Jason Kingsley OBE• Subject Matter Expert: Chris Carr• Camera: Jo Taylor• Camera: Dominic Read• Editing: Lindsey Studholme• Stills Photographer: Kasumi• Production Manager: Kevin Case• Audio: Frank Newman• Sound Design: Liam Flannigan• Music licensed from PremiumBeat• Additional Camera: Darren Cook• Additional Camera: Neil Phillips• Additional Sound: Elizabeth CarlyonSpecial Thanks:• Chris Payton• Ed SavageFacebook: www.facebook.com/modernhistorytv/Twitter: @ModernHistoryTVMany thanks to Chris Carr – check out www.brigaandfriends.co.uk",food

    LOBSTER BEACH BBQ! And Unique Kenyan Street Food in Malindi, Kenya!
  ","►Huge thank you to Coast Camping: http://coastcamping.co.ke/►Subscribe for 2 new videos per week: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe►T-shirts and caps available now: https://migrationology.com/store/►Farhana’s channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCruH...During my trip to Mombasa, we took a day trip to Malindi with the crew from Coast Camping (http://coastcamping.co.ke/). They offer off the beaten path tours around Mombasa and coastal Kenya. In this video, I didn’t pay for the tour, but I did pay for most of the food we ate on this tour. Thank you to Coast Camping for hosting me, and for being so cool!We first drove from Mombasa to Malindi, and before doing anything else, we stopped for a local breakfast. I enjoyed some mbaazi, which are pigeon peas in coconut milk, and a delicious Kenyan goat soup. Breakfast was excellent, and the perfect way to begin the day.One of the signature trips that Coast Camping takes is to the Malindi marine park to a sand bar, to go swimming and to  bbq lobster on the sand bar.  Unfortunately when  we got there, the tide didn’t cooperate with us, so it was too high to get out on the sand bar, but the water was still incredibly beautiful and pristine - we just couldn’t bbq there. So we continued to the shore where they set up the grill and we grilled  fish and lobster in on the beach with the incredible Indian Ocean sea breeze. We ate on the boat. The food was delicious, and I especially enjoyed the rice with prawns curry that was pre-cooked. Lobster and moon fish was also excellent!Halwa Asli - Back in Malindi town, one of the must eat foods halwa, a sweet that common throughout Arabia and India. This version was made with starch and sugar, and then cooked and simmered until it turned into a sticky paste. It was very sweet, but a few bites were great.We also stopped for one of the best Kenyan street food dishes to eat - a mix of bhajias and fried things, topped in chutney, with signature Malindi cassava and mango sauce.Vipingo Nyama Choma Mishkaki - On our way back  driving from Malindi to Mombasa we stopped to eat mishkaki at a legendary meat spot. The meat was so good, especially when dipped in the kachumbari of tomatoes, onions, and chili sauce.Price - 2,000 KES ($19.65) for everyoneIt was an incredible day on the coast of Kenya, beautiful scenery, and incredible Kenyan food!

    The King of Falafel - Street Food Icons
  ","King of Falafel & Shawarma has been serving mouthwatering Middle Eastern cuisine on the streets of Astoria for the last 17 years. The falafel recipe, with its unique oval shape, is a guarded secret of owner Freddy Zeideia, who mastered it with techniques he learned while growing up in Palestine. After being dissatisfied with the falafel and shawarma offerings in New York, Freddy took matters into his own hands by starting King of Falafel & Shawarma in 2002. Since then, his enterprise has grown, with a truck in Astoria, a cart in Midtown, and a newly opened restaurant in Queens. They also serve chicken over rice, kebabs, meatballs, and other Palestinian specialties.

    Organic food - hype or hope? | DW Documentary
  ","There is growing demand in the western world for organic food. But do consumers always get what it says on the label? How can authenticity be verified?Is organic food automatically healthier? Consumers are prepared to pay a significant premium for it. There are currently, however, no reliable tests for distinguishing organic from conventionally produced food. Farmers need to invest a great deal of time, energy and money to qualify as a producer of organic food. There is no proof, however, that organic food actually contains fewer contaminants than conventionally farmed products. There is no such thing as pollution-free food, and there are currently no tests available for reliably distinguishing between organic and non-organic food. That opens doors for lucrative labeling fraud, which in turn explains why there are far more organic eggs on the market at Easter than at any other time of the year. The statistics clearly suggest manipulation, but it is hard to obtain evidence due to the differences between the two production processes appearing to have little effect on the quality of the product. Irish dairy farmers, for instance, are not allowed to label their milk ""organic"" because the pasture land where their herds spend more than 300 days a year are treated with mineral fertilizers. Because cows are themselves bioreactors, however, the milk they yield contains no trace at all of fertilizer. On average, conventional Irish milk contains more omega 3 fatty acids and antioxidants than organic milk from Germany. The reason is the fodder; German organic farms may use only concentrates and silage as supplementary feed to increase milk output - which impacts negatively on the quality of the milk. This documentary looks at researchers who are studying potential ways of reliably distinguishing between organic and conventionally produced food. And that is no easy task. Nearly every foodstuff requires a specific test. But one thing is certain: organic farming makes a major contribution to human welfare - by helping to mitigate climate change, protect the groundwater, conserve nature and promote animal welfare._______DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

    7 DAY WATER FAST - NO FOOD FOR A WEEK (Before & After)
  ","DISCLAIMER: We are not doctors, nor experts on fasting. We do not recommend anyone do a medically unsupervised water fast. If we had not been in Northern Spain when Lou got injured, he would have gone to True North Health Center (https://www.healthpromoting.com/) in California to do his water fast with the support of their medical team. If you are under 18 years old, on medication, addicted to any substances, have currently or had a history of eating disorders, are pregnant or breastfeeding, have heart problems or any other diseases it is even more important that you seek the advice of a medical professional before attempting a water fast on your own. It might sound really crazy to you, but Lou did a 7 DAY WATER FAST! If you've never heard of a water fast, it is very simple: don't eat any food or drink anything other than pure filtered water for a specified amount of time, so for Lou that was one entire week without any food, no coffee, no tea, no lemon water, no juice, or vitamins - just plain filtered water and rest. You might be familiar with the trendy diet called Intermittent Fasting. Here people only eat in a certain window of time (16 hr fast/9 hr feed or 14 hr fast/10 hr feed) and while this has lots of touted health benefits, Lou was in need of relief fast from a horrible back injury and decided he'd do whatever he could to get results quickly as possible. One of the main benefits of fasting is the body's ability to reduce inflammation. Instead of spending lots of energy digesting food, the body can now work to rebuild the immune system and while there still aren't many long term trials of fasting's effects on humans, science is showing that fasting can be used to help treat a whole host of problems like heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, high blood pressure, and autoimmune diseases. Over 6 years ago Lou was diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis, which is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks the joints, and over the course of the last few years has been able to get off medication and manage his symptoms with the help of a low-fat oil free plant based vegan diet. However, when he does stray from a health-promoting diet his RA symptoms do begin to resurface. So while we're not sure if his back injury had to do with his RA, either way, the autoimmune disease makes his healing process extremely slow. We live in a van, so being immobile was actually a very scary experience, and left Lou to embark on this water fasting journey.  The before and after is astounding as his pain levels went from an 8 out of 10 to... well you have to watch for that! Before we get to the video, I just wanted to say that a lot of people come to water fasting searching for a quick fix for weight loss and I really recommend that you reconsider. Water fasting is a wonderful tool to manage health conditions with the help of doctor supervision, but when it comes to weight loss it might not be your most effective tool because if post fast you continue all the same habits you will be left in the same position. If you are searching for weight loss please research a low-fat plant-based diet, but mainly I want you to really think about where the desire to lose weight is coming from. Our society tells us constantly that we are not good enough and instead of buying into this lie, this might be the time you instead embrace yourself as you are. Focus on self-love, body-acceptance, and finding self-worth outside of ascetics. Diet culture is toxic, and while I know it's complicated for me to write about it as we are huge advocates for a low-fat vegan diet as its been an incredible tool to manage Lou's autoimmune disease, in the end, I want people to know that they are worthy as is. No crazy lifestyle changes will change your relationship to yourself unless you do the mental work. Thanks for being here with us and while I know water fasting might make a lot of people uncomfortable it was an incredible experience for Lou and I hope you can see how much it helped him.For more information please check out my blog post on Lou's 7 Day Water Fast Experience: https://www.wildweroam.com/blog/7dayw...New Mattress: Tussöy  IKEA mattress topper#waterfast #7daywaterfast #nofoodforaweek................Our newsletter:http://eepurl.com/disTjT.................MUSIC30 Day Free Trial for Epidemic Sound - http://share.epidemicsound.com/pl2WQ ........................................................Camera Gear*Video Camera: Canon EOS-1DX Mark II - https://amzn.to/2G9NskWMain Lens: Canon 24-105 f4 - http://amzn.to/2D1SA70Full gear list - https://www.wildweroam.com/gear........................................................Keep in Touch: on http://instagram.com/wildweroam* The gear section includes Amazon affiliate links.

    Opening decades-old canned foods
  ","Read!!! Be Safe, Don't trust food this old, not worth the risk. I actually found them in the basement at someones estate sale and bought them. Some are badly rusted. The one from 85 I think was real tin and that's why it didn't rust like the iron ones. Something may have been wrong with them so i didn't try them. I buried them in a compost pile afterwards, it rotted away. Personally I only trust cans up to three years old but if it's like evaporated milk-dairy not long at all. Thanks For Watching",food

    22 COCA COLA HACKS THAT WILL SHOCK YOU || Coca Cola Recipes, Tricks And Food Secrets
  ","INCREDIBLE USES OF COKEHey, guys! This time we prepared a cool collection with incredible uses of Coke you haven’t seen before! You will be surprised how multifunctional our favorite soda could be! Place hydrogel into a bottle of coke and use it as a vase for flowers. Besides, this case looks so cool! If you need to remove bubble gum from sneaker’s sole, Coke will easily cope with this problem. Resistant stains are a huge problem especially if it’s your favorite t-shirt or dress. But we know what to do! Again use Coke to solve this problem. Pour Coke on a resistant stain and leave for 10 minutes. After that wash as usual with detergent. The next idea is really cool! You can cook quick cupcakes with Coke! Follow this easy recipe: in a bowl, mix flour, baking powder, cocoa powder, sugar, butter, eggs, and Coke. Bake and enjoy! You can make caramelized bacon at home: place bacon in a baking tray and cover with Coke. Fry bacon and enjoy! You will be surprised but you can make a lip gloss with Coke flavor: mix Vaseline, melted coconut oil and coke. Microwave and pour into empty lipstick container. I bet you didn't know that you can clean your bathroom using Coke! Coke is perfect to clean ceramic tile. You can even create a beautiful blossom artwork using a recycled soda bottle. Take a sheet of paper, use dark paint and draw a tree with branches. Once the tree is ready, let it dry before continuing with the stamping. Pour some paint on a paper plate and dip the plastic bottle. This is really fun, add as many blossoms as you want. Have fun!TIMESTAMPS:01:02 How to get rid of stains01:14 Coke cupcakes01:57 Coke flavored lip gloss02:49 Caramelized bacon recipe----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/5min.crafts/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/5.min.crafts/Twitter: https://twitter.com/5m_craftsSubscribe to 5-Minute Crafts GIRLY: https://goo.gl/fWbJqzSubscribe to 5-Minute Crafts KIDS: https://goo.gl/PEuLVtSubscribe to 5-Minute Crafts MEN: http://bit.ly/2S69VUGThe Bright Side of Youtube: https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.meMusic by Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com/",food

I'm Ivana, nice to meet you! You'll find travel and food videos on this channel because I like to take you along while exploring the world. These videos hopefully make you excited to travel and eat food around the world as well. There's such a joy in getting out of your comfort zone and growing as human being by traveling to new places and eating delicious food you've never tasted before. I'm currently based in Bangalore because India is my favourite country in the world. Travel in India is kind of my thing but I've been al over the world. Just check these playlists to begin your journey with me: https://bit.ly/2l4sMk4FAQ's:Q Where are you from?A I am born in former Yugoslavia. Mom is Serbian, Dad is Bosnian. During the '90's war we came to the Netherlands and I got Dutch nationality. I've lived in Amsterdam for 8 years but lost my heart to India. Since 2018 I'm based in Bangalore. See this video for my refugee story: https://bit.ly/2l17T9hQ How can you afford to travel so much?A I saved for 3 years while working full time and now travel vlogging is my job. I work together with tourism agencies but also do some freelance work on the side. You can watch this video: https://youtu.be/vxfjQO_F1vE  and this one: https://youtu.be/dB7plg139wQ to learn more about my story.Q What camera do you film with and what editing software do you use?A Canon G7X Mark II and Final Cut Pro XQ (Why) Are you vegetarian?A I'm vegetarian but not strict. I don't eat any meat, fish, cooked/boiled or fried eggs. I gradually became a vegetarian over the course of 15 years because I disliked the taste of meat more and more. After doing a yoga teacher training in 2015 I also quit fish and the eggs. No matter my food preferences I have no issues with other people not being vegetarian. I don't judge others and kind of expect the same favor from others concerning my own food preferences. It makes for a more friendly world :-)Q Why do you usually travel alone?A Because my friends have jobs with limited holidays, kids and partners. Also I really like exploring on my own.Q Why do you love India so much?A Watch this video: http://bit.ly/2iyUKkc and this one: https://youtu.be/Sh7E9VisTKQQ How do you work together with brands?A Watch this video with the complete and honest truth about travel vlogging: https://youtu.be/ntL0MhxSneQ",food

    10 Foods You Should Never Eat
  ","We know some products are really dangerous for our health, and other products are good for us as they are healthy. It turns out it’s not so simple and some of the most promoted and popular foods can, in fact, harm you. Never eat these 10 dangerous foods for the sake of your own health and the health of your family. Even if you see the juice labels “not from concentrate” or “100% pure”, don't let this fool you. Juice, after being squeezed from different fruits, is kept in huge vacuum-sealed tanks where it can sit for up to a year before being packaged! And by that time, the juice has lost all its flavor, which is why manufacturers have to add artificial flavoring to make it taste fruity again.In most cases, cereals are loaded with refined carbohydrates and sugar. Even if the label assures you that it's fat-free and whole grain, check the list of ingredients. You'll most likely see that the product is full of sugar.Despite common belief, most yogurts don't contain probiotic bacteria since the process of pasteurization kills all these microorganisms. When consumed, trans-fats in ice-cream can cause high cholesterol, stroke, heart disease, and even cancer. Ice cream is also loaded with sugar, artificial flavors, and synthetic preservatives. And if it’s pink, purple, or red, it’s most likely been colored with cochineal extract or carmine, additives which can cause bad allergic reactions. Popcorn has some genetically modified ingredients as well as taste-boosting chemicals and additives. This leads to health problems such as heart attacks, digestive issues, allergies, skin rashes, breathing problems, and the depressing list goes on. Even more, popcorn is extremely caloric.Music: Vibe Mountain - Great HopeThe 126ers - Reversed EclipseRondo Brothers - Yellow GoldKevin MacLeod - Jay JaySilent Partner - Pink Lemonadehttps://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/...TIMESTAMPSFruit juices 0:37Energy bars 1:42Cereal 2:31Margarine 3:21Low-fat yogurt 4:11Ice cream 5:01Eggs 6:07Microwave popcorn 7:09Sugar-free candy 8:32Diet soda 9:26SUMMARY-Store-bought juices may contain some real fruit, but most of their content is water, sugar, and artificial flavoring.-Protein bars and energy bars alike are usually processed products containing sugar, artificial flavors and sweeteners.-Breakfast cereals typically contain a teeny tiny amount of whole grains, which allows producers to mark their product as healthy, but they also contain unhealthy sugar. -Margarine is typically made from industrial vegetable oils hydrogenated to become solid, a process that significantly increases the oils’ trans-fat content.-Manufacturers load “low-fat” yogurts with sugar to make up for the lack of taste usually provided by the natural fats.-Instead of pure milk or cream, manufacturers use cheaper hydrogenated fats such as palm- or coconut oil to produce ice-cream. These oils, when heated, become nothing more than trans-fats.-One egg contains as much cholesterol as a big greasy burger.-Microwave popcorn’s almost always lined with the same toxic substance you can find in Teflon pans.-If candy doesn’t contain sugar, it contains artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose, and saccharine. These substances are chemically processed and may cause some serious side effects.-Artificial sweeteners in diet soda can easily lead to weight gain as they trigger the production of insulin, which makes your body store fat.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",food

    Food as Medicine | Michael Greger, M.D. | TEDxSedona
  ","According to the Global Burden of Disease study (the largest study of disease risk factors in history; funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) the #1 cause of both death and disability in the United States is our diet. Cigarettes now only kill about a half million Americans every year, whereas our diet appears to kill hundreds of thousands more. The good news is that means we have tremendous power over our health destiny and longevity. Healthy eating has the potential to not only prevent, but reverse some of our leading causes of death including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure. Why, then, is nutrition not the #1 thing taught in medical school?

    Teach every child about food | Jamie Oliver
  ","http://www.ted.com Sharing powerful stories from his anti-obesity project in Huntington, W. Va., TED Prize winner Jamie Oliver makes the case for an all-out assault on our ignorance of food.Jamie Oliver is transforming the way we feed ourselves, and our children. Jamie Oliver has been drawn to the kitchen since he was a child working in his father's pub-restaurant. He showed not only a precocious culinary talent but also a passion for creating (and talking about) fresh, honest, delicious food. In the past decade, the shaggy-haired ""Naked Chef"" of late-'90s BBC2 has built a worldwide media conglomerate of TV shows, books, cookware and magazines, all based on a formula of simple, unpretentious food that invites everyone to get busy in the kitchen. And as much as his cooking is generous, so is his business model -- his Fifteen Foundation, for instance, trains young chefs from challenged backgrounds to run four of his restaurants.Now, Oliver is using his fame and charm to bring attention to the changes that Brits and Americans need to make in their lifestyles and diet. Campaigns such as Jamie's School Dinner, Ministry of Food and Food Revolution USA combine Olivers culinary tools, cookbooks and television, with serious activism and community organizing -- to create change on both the individual and governmental level.Join Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution: http://www.jamieoliver.com/campaigns/...TEDTalks is a daily video podcast of the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes.

    22 CRAZY FOOD HACKS YOU HAVE TO TRY
  ","DELICIOUS DISHES FOR A PARTYWe love candies and share a lot of ideas you can make using sweets. If you want to amaze your guests try to cook dishes we share! Make a cool decoration for a cake made from pears and candies. You can create a perfect flower that looks real. Make a huge lollipop with candies inside. It will be a perfect gift for kids. Decorate a cupcake with a flower made from lollipop and marshmallow. It will be a super cute flower for your candy bar. Another awesome idea is to make a lollipop out of sprite! Take a bowl a pour sprite, add food coloring and gelatin. Pour the mix into a mold for lollipops and freeze.  Do you want to cook something special for your home party? The recipe of black ice-cream: take a bowl and add heavy cream, sugar and activated charcoal. Beat the mixture and add dry rice. And mix again. This perfect dessert will amaze your friends! Moreover, we have one more cool idea to surprise your friends - vegan caviar. Take a pan and pour water into it, add sriracha and agar-agar and mix these ingredients. Simmer agar-agar and sriracha for two minutes. Take a tall glass and pour vegetable oil, put into the fridge and let cool. When the vegetable oil is cold, take a syringe and squeeze out spheres of the hot mixture into the cold oil. You will see bead shapes appearing that will sink to the bottom of the glass. To separate the oil from pearls wash them with some water. Now you have fake caviar to decorate a cake or everything you like!Camembert bread will be the best dish during your party. Cut off the top of the bread loaf, make a hole large enough to fit the camembert. Next, cut the top of camembert and place into the hole.

    Food for thought: How your belly controls your brain | Ruairi Robertson | TEDxFulbrightSantaMonica
  ","""Have you ever had a gut feeling or butterflies in your stomach? Has hunger ever changed your mood? Our bellies and brains are physically and biochemically connected in a number of ways, meaning the state of our intestines can alter the way our brains work and behave, giving a whole new meaning to 'Food for thought'. As a nutritionist, microbiologist and neuroscientist, Ruairi Robertson is passionate about the link between our bellies and brains. His research is examining how our intestines and the microbes within them can influence both physical and mental health, and most importantly how our diets influence this relationship. Ruairi has travelled the world researching food, and believes it is the key to global public health. Ruairi is a PhD student in University College Cork in Ireland and current Fulbright Scholar (2015/16) to Harvard University.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

    BEST AMSTERDAM FOOD EVER! | Top 7 Dutch Street Foods 🇳🇱 Albert Cuyp Market
  ","Eating delicious food such as waffles, cheesy chicken sandwich, raw fish, gouda cheese & more! THUMBS UP & SUBSCRIBE!! Eating the best Dutch street food in Amsterdam Subscribe to our channel: https://goo.gl/2OsFKVCheck out yesterday's vlog: https://youtu.be/xbeWVs2xyA4Website : http://yetanothervisarun.com/Instagram: http://bit.ly/2rEclwGPATRON: https://www.patreon.com/adrianapopeIn this video, I show you where to find the very best Amsterdam food! I take you on a walking tour of the Albert Cuyp Market in Amsterdam where I taste test many different Dutch street food items. Named after a 17th century painter, Albert Cuyp, the market has since become an institution for this bustling European city. Located on the Albert Cuypstraat (that is the name of the street) between Ferdinand Bolstraat and Van Woustraat...the market's central location makes it the perfect place to stroll through on the way to a nearby museum or on the way to a picnic. Visiting the Albert Cuyp Market is a definite must-see when you're in Amsterdam! Another plus is that this market is great for travelers on a budget because there are a lot of Amsterdam food options (traditional Dutch dishes) that can be had for under $3 Euro. A list of Amsterdam street food I ate at the Albert Cuyp Market:I began with my favorite item, the stroopwafel. When I think of Amsterdam food, stroopwafel is the first thing that comes to mind. Essentially it is a waffle, but it's nothing like an American waffle. This unique pastry is made with flour, butter and sugar, but the real excitement is in the middle of the waffle. The waffle is cut in the middle (which is a miracle because it is so thin!) and then copious amounts of brown sugar syrup are knifed onto it, and then it is sealed once again. Stroopwafel is best eaten warm! The predominant flavor is cinnamon and the waffle itself is both crisp on the outside but soft inside. It's absolutely delightful and it tasted a lot different than I was expecting. Next, I tried some raw herring called Nieuwe Herring which translates into “New Herring.”This means that the fish has either been caught that actual day or the day prior. Nieuwe Herring is another must try dish when it comes taste testing Amsterdam food! Since it was herring season in the summertime (until around Sept), I decided to try out some fresh herring the Dutch way (with pickles and raw onions). It was absolutely incredible! I am now a herring addict.After this I drank some fresh pressed raspberry juice mixed with blackberries and orange juice. You can find juice stands all along the market. A normal glass of juice costs around 1 EUR. Then after this, I moved onto a spicy chicken sandwich at Benny's Chicken. This food stand claims to have the best chicken in all of Amsterdam. After tasting their spicy chicken sandwich covered in cheese, I have to admit that is was really good! The pieces of chicken are succulent and juicy. Definitely a delicious sandwich if you're craving something cheesy!After this I bought some dates at Ron's Notenbar. Notenbars (which literally translates into “nut bar”) are a very common sight in Amsterdam. There are a couple notenbars at the Albert Cuyp Market and they all offer different items which is nice. Duchies love their fresh fruits and nuts, especially as a mid-day snack! I was impressed by their selection of dates, but I highly recommend getting a couple bags of different dried fruits and nuts.  Next, I purchased some aged gouda cheese at a cheese shop called Daalder Kaas. They sell traditionally ripened cheese and an array of aged gouda cheeses. I selected an aged gouda cheese which I thought was nice and creamy. It had a sharp flavor, but wasn't overwhelming. I thought all of the Amsterdam food I tasted at the market was wonderful!  Make sure to come earlier than 5pm as some vendors tend to pack up around 3pm (or when they sell out of the goods). It's best to arrive in the early afternoon.

Black WidowBoston resident Jorge Fuertes purchased a bag of Anthony’s brand red seedless grapes from a Whole Foods Market. Later, when he and his twenty-year-old son took a lunch break, they saw something strange in the bag. According to Fuertes, the bag was full of spider webs and between the grapes they could see a spider. As they inspected the bag, at least two more spiders crawled out, both black, shiny, and with the distinctive red hourglass. Yes, their bag of grapes contained black widows. These spiders, however, are rarely deadly. Their neurotoxic venom is extremely painful, though, causing muscle cramps, vomiting, and dizziness.Of course, Fuertes reported his find. Bags of Anthony’s brand grapes were pulled from the shelves of that store and the grocery store chain immediately began inspecting all produce. A spokesman for Whole Foods Market assured the public that they take every precaution to inspect produce but that spiders were “part of the natural environment where grapes are grown”.10. Frozen FrogWhen we open a bag of frozen veggies, we don’t expect to find a stowaway. In 2010, Marty Hoffman opened a bag for her dog. The Hoffman’s dog was on a special meat-and-vegetable diet to help with a skin condition. When she dumped out the bag, she saw something frozen that she at first thought was a weird looking asparagus. However, on closer inspection, she discovered it was a frog! The Hoffmans contacted the FDA, who didn’t respond as quickly as the family would have liked. I mean, who are you supposed to call when you find something weird in your food??They then reported their find to a local newspaper columnist, who in turn contacted the grocery store chain.That brand name of frozen vegetable was immediately pulled from shelves and inspected. No other frogs, though, were found and the whole incident was put down as a fluke. Supposedly, the FDA eventually got around to inspecting the factories where the vegetables were processed, but there’s no word on what they found. Rumors spread that the family intended to sue or capitalize on the viral event. However, the Hoffman family denied those rumors and say they still shop at the store where they bought the frozen vegetables. After all, what’s a tiny frozen frog going to do to you?8. A MouseMice tend to turn up a lot in places they don’t need to be. One such place would be a loaf of bread.In 2009, Oxfordshire resident, Stephen Forse, took out a loaf of Hovis Best of Both to make sandwiches for his children. He noticed a strange dark patch covering the corner of four slices. At first thinking it was a defect from the baking process, he took a closer look and realized it was a mouse. More horrifyingly, the mouse was missing a tail. Upon further investigation, no one could account for the tail. Whoops!!Forse turned the loaf over to environmental health officers. Friday Premier Foods, who make Hovis Best of Both, pled guilty for not properly inspecting their food at all stages of production. They were fined £5,500.

    How Long Foods Stay In Your Stomach
  ","How long does the process of digestion last? Do you find yourself still hungry no matter how much you eat? If so, you might be eating foods that are too high on the glycemic index. It’s definitely something worth knowing if you’re struggling with excess weight.  The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman’s terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body. Glucose is a simple sugar that gives your body energy, and you get it from the foods you eat.Your blood is what carries this sugar throughout your body to all your hungry cells and tissues. That’s why it’s called blood glucose. If you eat something that’s high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.TIMESTAMPS: What glycemic index is 0:58Foods that digest slowly 3:30Foods that digest moderately 4:08Foods that digest quickly 4:34 Foods that don’t have a glycemic index value 5:27What about pizza? 6:09 Are all low-glycemic foods healthy? 6:43Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/SUMMARY: - The glycemic index is a system of values given to foods according to how quickly they cause an increase in blood glucose levels. To put that in layman’s terms, it basically measures how fast different foods are digested by the body.- If you eat something that’s high on the index, your blood glucose will spike, giving you a fast boost of energy.- Foods and drinks are actually split into three groups: low, medium, and high. Low items rate from 1 to 55, medium is from 56 to 69, and high items are from 70 and above.- According to the experts at Bodytomy, some low-glycemic foods, like cooked vegetables or a salad, can remain in your stomach anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.- There are also foods that really don’t really have a glycemic index value since they don’t contain any carbs. But they can still take a while to be digested by your stomach. It can take you anywhere from 2 to 5 hours for your stomach to digest meats, like chicken, lamb, and pork.- If you’re having pizza that’s just dough, cheese, and sauce, that might rate high on the glycemic index, mostly because of that dough. But believe it or not, adding toppings actually makes your slice healthier!- You might encounter foods that will be low on the index, but if they’re processed, they most likely still contain tons of saturated fats, sugar, and empty calories.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",food

  ","Author,  activist, and Project Director of the Food MythBusters, Anna Lappe takes on the billion-dollar business of marketing junk food, soda, and fast food to children and teens. With diet-related related illnesses alarmingly on the rise, pervasive marketing of junk food to kids is downright dangerous. The food industry says its up to parents to raise healthy kids. Lappe agrees, that's why she says leave parenting to her--and the millions of moms and dads trying to raise healthy kids. Learn about the dubious marketing tactics of the junk food giants and the ways you can fight back to promote kids' health. Anna Lappe is a national bestselling author and a founding principal of the Small Planet Institute and Small Planet Fund. Anna's most recent book is Diet for a Hot Planet: The Climate Crisis at the End of Your Fork and What You Can Do About It, named by Booklist and Kirkus as one of the best environmental book's of the year.

    15 Foods That Reduce Your Heart Attack Risk According to Doctors
  ","Do you want to clean your blood vessels? How to decrease the risk of heart attacks in the future? Are you ready to improve your overall well-being? Here are 15 food products that can take care of your heart and prevent heart diseases. Our heart is one of the most important organs, but, surprisingly, we take care of it the least, loading it every day with stress and unhealthy diets. And that's too bad because fatty food increases cholesterol levels, which leads to vascular plaques that prevent the heart from working correctly. In this video, you will get familiar with 15 products that perform all these activities! Some of them might surprise you with their health benefits!Watch till the end - as a bonus, you will find a recipe for a special drink for healthy blood vessels. And remember to press the like button in appreciation of our work!TIMESTAMPSFatty fish 1:05Oatmeal 1:51Berries 2:30Dark chocolate 3:19Nuts 4:00Extra virgin olive oil 4:45Red wine 5:23Green tea 5:53Broccoli and spinach 6:35Avocado 7:39Pomegranate 8:13Cinnamon 8:43Watermelon 9:14Garlic 9:43Apples and pears 10:28SUMMARY- Salmon, mackerel, herring, haddock, and other fatty fish decrease the risk of arrhythmia and atherosclerosis. They also contain lots of vitamins as well as minerals. - Rich in fiber, porridge decreases the levels of ""bad"" cholesterol and improves digestion. Coarse oatmeal is the healthiest. - Blueberries and strawberries are very good at lowering blood pressure and dilating blood vessels. Strawberry-lovers also get fiber, folate, antioxidants, and potassium from their favorite berries. - Dark chocolate provides the anti-stress effect as it increases the production of serotonin which is known for its calming effect. Cocoa, the main component of dark chocolate, also helps to prevent memory decline. - Nuts contain protein fibers that are useful for the heart. They also have vitamin E as their ingredient which helps to decrease the levels of ""bad"" cholesterol. - Olive oil is very high in oleic acid which reduces blood pressure. It is interesting that when the olives are crashed, oil leaves them naturally; therefore, beneficial ingredients and vitamins are not harmed by chemicals or preservatives. - French scientists have also found out that red wine contains some elements which can prolong a human lifespan for about 60 percent! Saying this, it still should be consumed in moderation. - Green tea makes the brain function better. This drink may decrease the risk of different types of cancer (such as prostate and breast cancer).- Broccoli, in particular, has a lot of medicinal benefits, such as prevention of some kinds of cancer, digestive system improvement, detoxification of the body. It also resembles a vitamin injection, filling you with numerous vitamins and minerals. - Avocados are packed with fiber, which can be useful for weight loss, blood sugar reduction, and other health-benefitting processes. - Pomegranates contain antioxidants, lower blood pressure, normalize blood circulation and increase hemoglobin levels. - Cinnamon can protect you from heart diseases and atherosclerosis. It also boosts metabolism and helps you to lose weight. - Watermelon plays an important role in vascular health. It stabilizes the cholesterol levels and contains antioxidants. It provides hydration, which is a great thing for your body. - Garlic dilates the vessels, lowers blood pressure, alleviates vasoconstriction, and prevents atherosclerotic plaques from appearing. It improves digestion as well, assisting in the functioning of the intestines. - Apples and pears are rich in fiber that helps your heart. They normalize blood circulation and are cheaper and more readily available alternatives to pomegranates. Besides, apples will help to maintain white and healthy teeth.

    20 Foods That'll Help You Lose Belly Fat
  ","​These are the top 20 foods you should eat to help lose belly fat. Not only do these meals help you lose weight fast, but they'll also help you build lean muscle mass. Some of these are my person favorites so I truly consider these some of the best diet foods for weight loss for both men & women. You can create your own​ meal plan with these. Enjoy!🔥 FREE 6 Week Body Transformation Challenge: http://bit.ly/lose-fat35☝️☝️☝️Fat Loss Calculator: http://bit.ly/2O4XdU7TIMESTAMPS:Avocado 0:42Eggs 1:17Berries 1:46Apple Cider Vinegar 2:20Tuna 3:14Salmon 3:37Green Tea 4:01Green Leafy Veggies 4:29Chicken Breast 5:01Sweet Potatoes 5:30Oatmeal 5:52Beans 6:19Brown Rice 6:59Chili Pepper 7:22Grapefruit 7:42Soup 8:09Protein Powder 8:34Coffee 9:11Asparagus 9:59Peanut Butter 10:19If you're seriously trying to lose belly fat then you already know that diet is one of the most important pieces of the puzzle. With a proper diet plan where you're eating the right foods in the right amounts you'll strip off layer after layer of body fat and say goodbye to that belly forever. However, if you're eating the wrong things you'll only be setting yourself back further and further. With an improper diet plan you'll have to get used to loosening your belt notch after notch because your belly fat will be there to stay. So to ensure that you aren't making any mistakes with the food you're selecting I want to go over the 20 best foods that you should be eating regularly to lose that belly fat for good. The first food I want to start with is the avocado. Unlike other fruits that are loaded with carbs, Avocados are full of healthy monounsaturated fats specifically oleic acid. They are also full of fiber which will help you feel full for longer. Another great thing about avocados that was discovered during a study from The Ohio State University at Columbus is that avocados help you absorb more cartenoids from fruits and vegetables, up to 15x more to be exact. So not only will avocados help you burn fat, but you'll also be strengthening your immune system and absorbing more cancer fighting cartenoids than ever. Next we have eggs. Eggs are great to incorporate into your diet plan because they’re high in protein, high in healthy fats and they can help you feel full for a very low amount of total calories. Eggs are also one of the most bioavailable sources of protein out there. Meaning that your body can very efficiently digest, absorb, and assimilate the protein found in eggs. Having a solid protein source like eggs in your diet will help you prevent muscle loss while you eat less calories to create enough of a deficit to burn fat. Lets move on to one of the best fruits you can eat while trying to lose belly fat...berries. Compared to most other fruits berries are very low in carbohydrates, while being full in vitamins and antioxidants. These antioxidants can help improve blood flow delivering more oxygen to your muscles and your cells in general. Ultimately this can hep improve your workouts while assisting with the fat loss process. The best low carb berries to eat are blackberries, raspberries, and strawberries. Blueberries are going to be a bit higher in carbs, so to keep calories low stick with the other 3. The next food isn't really a food, but instead its a drink that's been proven very effective at helping you fight that belly fat...apple cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar has been shown to help people lose weight and waist circumference. These aren't they typical animal studies that you constantly see that don't necessarily guarantee the same results for people. Instead these are human studies. One of these studies was 12 weeks long and it demonstrated that obese individuals could lose anywhere from 2.6 to 3.7 pounds just by consuming 1 to 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar per day. It has also been shown to improve blood sugar spikes after meals, and it can help increase fullness after a meal. In fact one study showed that taking apple cider vinegar with a high carb meal could result in people eating 200 to 275 less calories for the day. Keep in mind, you want to make sure that you dilute only one to two tablespoons of the apple cider vinegar in water. Don't drink it straight up. Next I have another high protein food for you and that's tuna. Tuna is a very lean fish that's pretty much entirely made up of protein. This makes tuna a great option to increase protein intake without increasing calorie intake too much. The important thing is if you're buying canned tuna you want to make sure you get the tuna in water not oil. If you get it in oil then all the extra calories that you save from this low fat fish will be canceled out. Fish in general is a great option for when you're trying to burn fat🔥 FREE 6 Week Body Transformation Challenge: http://bit.ly/lose-fat35☝️☝️☝️",food

    These 8 ""Healthy"" Foods are Making You Fat!
  ","Get ripped in 90 days - http://athleanx.com/x/my-workoutsSubscribe to this channel here - http://bit.ly/2b0coMWEating healthy is a requirement if you want to get ripped and lose body fat fast.  The problem is, often times foods masquerade themselves as healthy when they are anything but.  In this video, I show you how to spot the 8 biggest healthy foods making you fat.  We call these trap foods because they sneak up on you when you least expect it.I don’t care how much you are training or working out, if you refuse to get your nutrition in check you will never look as lean as you should or could.  Proper nutrition and good food choices are required to get ripped.  What I hate however is when you are misled into thinking that certain foods should be in your diet because they are “healthy”.  You blindly trust the guidance and then wind up frustrated when you aren’t seeing the results for your efforts.  In order to fix this once and for all, you simply have to educate yourself about these traps so you can avoid them in favor of better choices.First up is guacamole.  Recently, I did a video on how the healthy fats in avocado are great for your body.  The problem is, people confuse healthy foods for lean foods.  Packing a huge calorie wallop with every tablespoon, we tend to overlook the impact eating this food can quickly have on our waistline by eating almost 10-12 tablespoons per serving on average.  Sure, healthy fats are healthy, but like anything else…eaten in excess you will quickly run into trouble with them.Low fat or lite versions of foods are often way worse than the full fat, regular versions.  Beyond the fact that they usually just do a sugar for fat swap, you’re also getting a bunch of chemicals thrown in to these highly processed foods that you probably want to avoid all together.Now I know a lot of people like to have their morning glass of OJ or other fruit juice, but if you are looking to get ripped then you are far better off opting for water and getting your fruit in solid form.  The amount of sugars packed into these “healthy” drinks is astounding.  In fact, you are likely to find that a comparison between them and a glass of soda yield almost the same amount.  Add in the fact that liquid calories are far too easy to consume (and don’t provide the fiber benefits of the solid forms) and you’ve got another reason to avoid these.Sushi is supposed to be a healthy food option that packs a protein punch in the process.  Not so fast.  In fact, with just a sliver of fish in every piece, you’re getting just 15% protein and instead packing in the starchy carbs with enough sticky rice to hold a small fort together!  Add in the sodium IV drip you’re getting from your “low sodium” soy sauce and you’ve just made another perfect trap food.  Opt for the sashimi instead and you’ll get what you thought you were getting when you iniitally decided on having sushi.There’s something about the word granola that just sounds so healthy.  Maybe it’s that it sounds like the word grain?  Whatever the case, you can’t ignore the fact that this is made up of calorically dense ingredients that just won’t play well in an attempt to lose fat.  If you don’t make it yourself then you’re going to be guaranteeing yourself a ton of sugar and syrup as well, as both are needed to hold all of this “goodness” together.There are more trap foods not covered here in the description but you will find in this video.  You want to be sure if you are not avoiding them all together that you are at least educated about their pitfalls so you can limit them in your diet when you are trying to get and stay lean.

    6 High Estrogen Foods MEN SHOULD AVOID!
  ","These are 6 High Estrogen Foods Men Should Avoid to build muscle, lose weight, and get lean. Some foods should be limited and others should be completely avoided. Instead of increasing estrogen most men want to learn how to increase testosterone naturally & fast. By learning how to decrease estrogen levels, weight loss becomes much easier. 🔥 FREE 6 Week Body Transformation Challenge: http://bit.ly/lose-fat5Fat Loss Calculator: http://bit.ly/2S5ltXiTimestamps:Soy - 0:41 Wheat and grain based products - 2:32 Processed Carbs and Refined Sugars - 3:52Beer - 5:28 Beans - 7:12Bottled Water - 8:27The next food that you'll want to limit to keep your estrogen levels down is wheat and grain based products. These foods are extremely high in a type of xenoestrogen known as zearalenone or ZEA. ZEA is molecularly similar to estrogen and acts like estrogen in the body. One study examined the effect that ZEAs had on a drug called Letrozole, which is specifically designed to lower estrogen levels in the body. Bodybuilders will often take it get to really low levels of body fat. The researchers found that, even small amounts of ZEA negated the effects of Letrozole. That’s a powerful indicator of the estrogen boosting effect of all those ZEA’s that are found in wheat and grain products. As well as the ZEA problem, wheat also contains phytoestrogens. They’re found in the wheat germ which is the reproductive part of the wheat seed. These phytoestrogens will bind to estrogen receptor sites in your body’s cells. In a study that was designed to investigate the combined effect of wheat germ and a breast cancer treatment pharmaceutical it was noted that one of the side effects of wheat germ was that it increased estrogen receptor activity of MCF-7 cells. However, refined grain products remove the germ, making them slightly less of a problem when it comes to estrogen. Overall though, you should limit your consumption of wheat and grain based products. Our third estrogen food type to avoid is processed carbs and refined sugars. Hopefully, you’ve already cut back on these types of foods if you're trying to bring your body fat levels down. But there’s an extra reason to ditch these types of carbs. And it has to do with that powerful blood sugar regulating hormone, insulin. As well as causing you to store more body fat, insulin lowers your body’s levels of what is known as sex hormone binding globulin. The job of this globulin is to bind the two sex hormones, testosterone and estrogen, together. When it's doing its job properly, you will have limited amounts of free estrogen in your body. But, when it's stopped from doing its job, the opposite will be the case, your free estrogen levels will be much higher. It’s the insulin response that occurs when you eat refined sugar foods that causes the interference in the activity of sex hormone binding globulin. An interesting study that focused on women showed that drinking sugar laden sodas increased estrogen levels. The interesting thing was that increased estrogen levels did not occur with either diet sodas or fruit juices. Researchers believe this is due to the fact that diet sodas don’t contain refined sugar and fruit juice contains natural fruit sugars. Another estrogen related problem with sugar consumption is that, eating too much sugar leads to an increase in stored body fat. Fat cells excrete estrogen. So, the more fat cells that you have sitting around your body, the more estrogen you’ll have floating around as well. This is additional to the estrogen produced by the endocrine system. So, rather than reaching for a sweet sugar saturated treat, do your estrogen levels a favor and opt for foods that are high in proteins, fiber and healthy fats. Our fourth no go food for estrogen is beer. I know, this is a tough one. Now, I’m not saying you can’t drink it at all, but if you want to get really lean and maximize your muscle mass and strength, then you gotta’ cut back on the booze.  Here’s why. As you know beer contains hops. But what are hops? Well, they're actually the female part of the hop plant. They’re a preservative that has been added to beer for🔥 FREE 6 Week Body Transformation Challenge: http://bit.ly/lose-fat5References:https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/track...https://www.cell.com/cell-chemical-bi...https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1...https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article...https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publicatio...https://www.nature.com/articles/s4146...https://www.sciencedirect.com/science...http://jmclachlan.tulane.edu/PDFs/bou...https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/a...https://www.cambridge.org/core/journa...",food

    Food Matters (PART 1) - First 8 Minutes
  ","Dear Friend,What you're about to learn could likely save your life, or that of someone you love. This was certainly the case with my Father. About 6 years ago my Father was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Depression and Anxiety. The best the medical profession could offer was a cocktail of medications to treat the symptoms and little in the way of hope for treating the underlying causes. Not surprisingly his health continued to decline.At the same time we were studying nutrition and sending my father many books we had read but these didn't seem to help convince him. So for the next 12 months (with 3 years of research up our sleeves) we set about creating the independent documentary film 'Food Matters'.'Food Matters' features interviews with leading health experts who reveal the best natural healing choices you can make for you and your family's health. In the film you'll discover what works, what doesn't and what's killing you.Needless to say after my father saw the film he quit his pharmaceutical meds, changed his diet, lost 20% of his body weight and is now running 3 times a week which is a big change from being bed ridden for 5 years!Thank you for your support in helping this lifesaving information reach more people, it would not be possible without you.James Colquhoun & Laurentine ten BoschProducer / Directors 'Food Matters'PS: You don't have to take our word for it, here is what others are saying about the film.  ""Everything I have been harping on for the last 40 years, these two have brilliantly encapsulated in one beautifully produced, eminently watchable video."" - Harvey Diamond, Author of America's best selling health book 'Fit For Life'""This film lays out the inconvenient truth the food industry doesn't want you to hear -- that nearly all degenerative disease is actually caused by the processed, nutrient-depleted food being consumed in first-world nations around the world. 'Food Matters' dares to reveal how we can stop this cycle of destruction and restore true health to ourselves and our planet."" - Mike Adams founder of Natural News.com ""Anyone who is serious about their health needs to see this stunning film.""- Christiane Northrup, MD, author of the Women's Wisdom series ""James and Laurentine provide a radiant beacon of hope with steps you can do today to take control of your health and begin healing. This is such important information - and much aligned with my personal health philosophies. It's time to get it out to everyone who will listen.

    Street Food in Singapore at a Hawker Centre (小贩中心 - 熟食中心)
  ","For lunch in Singapore we enjoy feasting on Singaporean Street Food at a Hawker Centre located nearby the Singapore Flyer along the Singapore Food Trail. When I lived in South Korea as an English teacher (prior to traveling around other countries in Asia) I thought Korean street food reigned supreme. Although street food in Korea is among the best in Asia (if not the world), it certainly has some stiff competition from the likes of Taiwan, Thailand and Malaysia. Well, you can throw Singapore into the ring of contenders as well. With Hawker centres, open air food stall complexes, serving up a plethora of inexpensive Asian delights from around the region there is something for everyone to enjoy.GEAR WE USEOlympus OM-D E-M5 II: http://amzn.to/1OchS7tCanon G7X: http://amzn.to/1YdjsYX Olympus 14-150mm II Lens: http://amzn.to/1Y79zeM Rode Video Mic GO: http://amzn.to/1WDKtVM Joby Gorilla Pod: http://amzn.to/1PgoY5F SanDisk 16GB Extreme Pro: http://amzn.to/25KEErs SOCIAL MEDIA & TRAVEL BLOGSAUDREY:blog: http://thatbackpacker.com/instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thatbackpac...facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thatbackpackertwitter: https://twitter.com/ThatBackpacker SAMUEL:blog: http://nomadicsamuel.com/ facebook: https://www.facebook.com/nomadicsamuel twitter: https://twitter.com/NomadicSamuelinstragram: https://www.instagram.com/nomadicsamuel/Considering Singapore is one of the most (if not the most) expensive cities in all of Asia to visit, these Hawker centers are a lifeline for budget travelers who are already being squeezed by the astronomical price of accommodations.We spotted a Hawker Center nearby the Singapore Flyer called the Singapore Food Trail to try for our first meal in this futuristic city state.We ended up trying Hainanese chicken rice, dim sum, satay, butter chicken and Naan. I was the perfect way to have enough energy to continue exploring the city on foot.熟食中心  -   小贩中心Hawker Centres, which are open air food stall complexes, serve up a variety of inexpensive food.From Chinese to Indian and Malaysian to Indonesian there is a diverse selection of cuisine to choose from.We're having our first lunch here in Singapore at a Hawker Center and I've ordered myself some Chinese food.  I have some Hainanese chicken rice, which looks absolutely delicious and I've got a butter chicken with butter naan right down here.Here is my dish - it is just a bit of plain rice and some chicken with crispy skin on the outside.  Despite it looking a bit bland it is actually quite tasty.It is hard not to enjoy butter chicken - this is awesome.We've got a few more snacks to complete the meal.  What are they?  This is a combination of satay and dim sum, so we have sweet potato here and this one is yam.  We've got tofu cubes over here.  This one is prawn and I believe that is a shrimp dumpling.I'm going for something a little sweet here.  I have some kind of yam spring roll.  Should I dip it in peanut sauce?  Nah, just have it.  Is it sweet?  It is.  It tastes like sweet potato except that it is white.  This crab didn't go on a skewer and it will taste good in the peanut sauce I'm pretty sure.  We'll mix that bad boy around.  What is happening over there?  Kind of chewy?  Here is the crab!  Nice claw.Oh, that is delicious.  It is so juicy inside.As budget travelers these Hawker centres in Singapore are a real find.  Because it is really expensive in Singapore - it is one of the most expensive cities in all of Asia - certainly in Southeast Asia.  You can find dishes here for between four to ten Singaporean dollars and it is so much cheaper than eating in a restaurant.I like the variety that you can find at the Hawker centers.  For example, today we had some Indian food, Chinese food and we also saw stands selling Malaysian food, Singaporean dishes and lots of other things.This Hawker center is by the Singapore Flyer but you can find them all throughout the city.This is part of our Travel in Singapore series.

    YUMMY DESSERTS | PASTRY CHEF HACKS | AMAZING FOOD COMPILATION
  ","Most satisfying cake decorating ideas compilation. Amazing tasty food compilation. Delicious desserts. Best food art & tutorials. TIMESTAMPS0:01 – meringue disco ball.  Pip the meringue on the inside of a half sphere mold so that you can get a webbed/holey effect to the meringue ball. 0:55 – meringue donut/ meringnut/ doreingue. Grease the donut tin with a bit of butter then line it with strips of baking paper - then once it's baked you just lift it from the strips of paper and BAM - meringnut! You can fill it with a strawberry cream, crushed sweet cookies, and fresh blackberries. 1:50 –chocolate technique. So what you’ve got to do is add tempered chocolate to a piping bag, then pipe it into ice cold water (you could use ice cold alcohol). Let it sit for about 10-15s then mold it in your hands into a nest or whatever shape you want. The chocolate essentially seizes in the ice water and creates these cool shapes. It's a little bit fiddly and I definitely need to work on making some better shapes! The whole dessert is a coffee mousse entremets, with a chocolate & hazelnut brownie disc, pink velvet spray, gold dust and a tempered chocolate nest. 2:44 – coconut bay macarons. Vanilla macaron shells dipped in chocolate then coated in sweet coconut flakes filled with chocolate ganache and topped with a vanilla meringue kiss.3:28 –meringue design technique. Make a polka dot meringue cylinder filled with a mascarpone cream, raspberry compote, and a pastry disc. It ended up looking like a mini cake.4:25 – this is a chocolate pastry case filled with chocolate creme patisserie (which is on its own, one of the greatest fillings EVER) topped with toasted vanilla meringue. 4:53 – Captain America/ 4th July/ Spiral Macarons.  This is such a fun, but painstaking technique - it takes a good 15m to pipe one tray. You can fill them with vanilla cream and melted chocolate.5:46 – chocolate meringue macarons. 6:45 – this is a sweet pastry case filled with vanilla pastry cream, flourless chocolate cake, a raspberry coulis disc and then topped with a vanilla mousse sphere and toasted Italian meringue.7:45 – vanilla macarons with a mascarpone vanilla cream and a sticky cinnamon apple compote in the middle. It’s just thinly sliced apple, held together with a toothpick then carefully fanned out - so easy to do. A good little tip is to spritz the apple with a bit of lemon juice to stop them browning.8:43 –a really simple apple tart just made a lil’ fancy with a swirl of freshly sliced apple, and an on top._____________________________________________________________Via:https://instagram.com/toplessbaker/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOvP... _____________________________________________________________Don’t forget to turn on notifications, like, & subscribe!Subscribe to You're Gorgeous: https://goo.gl/QWVfMz _____________________________________________________________Our Social Media: Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/gorgeous.side 5-Minute Crafts GIRLY YouTube - https://goo.gl/B7VGSh_____________________________________________________________For more videos and articles visit: http://www.brightside.me/",food

    Top Foods That Bloat You (Stomach and Face Bloating)
  ","Click Here to Subscribe: http://Bit.ly/ThomasVidWebsite: http://ThomasDeLauer.com20% Off my Keto Collagen Protein: http://www.perfectketo.com/thomas-del...Top Foods That Bloat You (Stomach and Face Bloating)Facial BloatingFacial bloating is most prominent in the morning upon waking up (cause you’ve been lying down → gravity), however, it can continue throughout the dayCause - Dehydration Dehydration - SleepMany people incorrectly assume that high water consumption leads to bloating - In reality, dehydration results in fluid retention, particularly in the face (sleeping results in mild dehydration)It makes urine output decrease and instead of processing liquid out of the body, the water is reabsorbed into the tissue. When this occurs, swelling, and possibly pain, will resultIn other words, dehydration causes a buildup of fluid in the tissues and causes blood vessels to enlarge, which gives the face a “puffy” look Dehydration - SodiumHigh sodium intake is the number one culprit for fluid retention - the typical american diet is plagued with excessive sodium levelsThe job of the kidneys is to filter the excess sodium into the urine so that the body can get rid of it - Sodium attracts water to it and is known as being osmotic. Water follows the sodium and is drawn into the bloodstream. Excessive salt keeps the circulatory volume higher than it should be, creating and increased pressure in the blood stream and pressing on the blood vessel walls  (5)One way to flush sodium out of the body is by getting more potassium - We average 2,500 mg a day, about half of the 4,700 mg minimum recommended for adultsPotassium blunts the effects of sodium by helping relax the walls of blood vessels - The more potassium we eat, the more sodium we pass out of the body through urine. Cream of Tartar: Cream of tartar, also called potassium hydrogen tartrate, provides a bioavailable form of potassium rather than taking a potassium supplement One teaspoon of cream of tartar = 495 mg of potassiumNote: Most people don’t realize that fresh and frozen poultry is sometimes injected with a sodium solution - so check the labelStomach Bloating Stomach bloating is the result of gas or fluid accumulating in your GI tract, or when bacteria in your large intestine have a hard time breaking down certain foods The most common type of foods that cause stomach bloating are high FODMAP foods. FODMAP is an acronym that stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols Since your body is unable to completely digest these sugar molecules, they travel through your GI tract and reach your colon undigested, where the bacteria that live in your colon begin to ferment them. The fermentation can produce gas and bloatingRaw Cruciferous Vegetables (Kale, Broccoli, Cabbage) Cruciferous veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, etc.) cause bloating and gas when eaten in their raw form - extremely high in insoluble fiber, which can be difficult for your body to break down. Cooking vegetables helps break down the fibers they contain, which makes them easier on the digestive system because they’re already partly broken down. Cruciferous veggies also contain raffinose, a sugar molecule - Raffinose cannot be broken down in the small intestine as humans lack the alpha-galactosidase enzyme required to break it down. It passes through your GI tract completely undigested. Once it reaches the large intestine though, the bacteria there thrive on it and ferment raffinose into large volumes of hydrogen, methane and other gases. Fermented Veggies: Sauerkraut, kim chi, sauerruben and curtido are excellent alternatives for people with gut issues. First, the fermentation process “pre-digests” the vegetables and makes them easier to absorb. Second, fermented veggies contain probiotic microorganisms that help heal the gutReferences1) Bloating and functional gastro-intestinal disorders: where are we and where are we going? - PubMed - NCBI.

    क्यूँ आये थे मुघल भारत में , जानिये असलीयत इतिहासकी  | History Of India
  ","क्यूँ आयेथे मुघल भारत में , जानिये असलीयत इतिहासकी  | History Of IndiaThe Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia (Uzbekistan). Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Timur on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother’s side.Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun’s triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions, and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari river. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government and supported cultural developments. At the same time Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. The Indian historian Abraham Eraly wrote that foreigners were often impressed by the fabulous wealth of the Mughal court, but the glittering court hid darker realities, namely that about a quarter of the empire's gross national product was owned by 655 families while the bulk of India's 120 million people lived in appalling poverty.After suffering what appears to have been an epileptic seizure in 1578 while hunting tigers, which he regarded as a religious experience, Akbar grew disenchanted with Islam, and came to embrace a syncretistic mixture of Hinduism and Islam.Akbar allowed free expression of religion and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult. He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge. Akbar's son, Jahangir, ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques. During the reign of Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenueSubscribe Us : https://goo.gl/mRFqpS",history

    5 Most Amazing Accidental Historical Discoveries
  ","5 Most Amazing Accidental Historical DiscoveriesRich soil always appreciates good care so it can provide miraculous natural gifts to the farmer. However, James Bristle, a farmer from Michigan, got something more exciting from the ground. He had a field to grow soybeans and one day he noticed something sticking out of the ground that looked like an old decayed fence post at first sight. However, the find turned out to be much more amazing. James got an excavator to dig deeper and was stunned to see a well-preserved skull. These were the bones of a wooly mammoth that lived on the planet about 15,000 years ago. The multiton giant was approximately 40 years old when it died. Archaeologists found most of the animal’s skeleton, including the almost intact skull with tusks, though they did not find its limbs. Apparently, some hunters separated and took the limbs and put the mammoth’s body in storage. It is noteworthy that James exercised his right to keep some of the mammoth remains and gave most of the bones and the skull to a local museum. That was the first discovery, let’s see what’s next!",history

  ","History of Catherine the Great of Russia | Catherine the Great►TopicCatherine II (Russian: Екатерина Алексеевна Yekaterina Alekseyevna; 2 May [O.S. 21 April] 1729 – 17 November [O.S. 6 November] 1796), also known as Catherine the Great (Екатери́на Вели́кая, Yekaterina Velikaya), born Princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst, was Empress of Russia from 1762 until 1796, the country's longest-ruling female leader. She came to power following a coup d'état that she organised—resulting in her husband, Peter III, being overthrown. Under her reign, Russia was revitalised; it grew larger and stronger and was recognised as one of the great powers of Europe.In her accession to power and her rule of the empire, Catherine often relied on her noble favourites, most notably count Grigory Orlov and Grigory Potemkin. Assisted by highly successful generals such as Alexander Suvorov and Pyotr Rumyantsev, and admirals such as Fyodor Ushakov, she governed at a time when the Russian Empire was expanding rapidly by conquest and diplomacy. In the south, the Crimean Khanate was crushed following victories over the Ottoman Empire in the Russo–Turkish wars, and Russia colonised the territories of Novorossiya along the coasts of the Black and Azov Seas. In the west, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, ruled by Catherine's former lover, king Stanisław August Poniatowski, was eventually partitioned, with the Russian Empire gaining the largest share. In the east, Russia started to colonise Alaska, establishing Russian America.#cathrine#discoverthefacts#russia► Keyword►Disclaimer- Some contents are used for educational purpose under fair use.

    Britain BC: Episode 1 (Ancient History) | History Documentary | Reel Truth History
  ","Using reconstructions, aerial photography and computer generated imaging we'll be able to put forward a vivid and fascinating image of how advanced Britain really was in the five thousand years before Christ: In these films Francis Pryor will present the most comprehensive vision of pre-Roman Britain ever shown on television. Drawing on a sea of new evidence Dr Pryor, one of Britain's leading archaeologists, will paint a picture of the Ancient Britons that flatly contradicts the received wisdom that they were crude savages. They were in fact a highly developed people, with their own strong sense of culture, long before the Romans arrived. Understanding who we were then, he argues, is crucial to understanding who we are today. The Ancient Britons are not them, they're us.To be the first to watch more full length documentaries, subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to Reel Truth History, the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

    Yamaha Motorcycles - History (From 1955)
  ","The motorcycle division of Yamaha was founded in 1955, and was headed by Genichi Kawakami. Yamaha's initial product was a 125cc two-cycle, single cylinder motorcycle, the YA-1, which was a copy of the German DKW RT125. The YA-1 was a competitive success at racing from the beginning, winning not only the 125cc class in the Mt. Fuji Ascent, but also sweeping the podium with first, second and third place in the All Japan Autobike Endurance Road Race that same year.[6] Early success in racing set the tone for Yamaha, as competition in many varieties of motorcycle racing has been a key endeavor of the company throughout its history, often fueled by a strong rivalry with Honda and other Japanese manufacturers.[ I do not own any contents in the video.

In the first video, I told you about the origins of Rome, its slow emergence and wars until the 1st Century BC - including the founding of the Republic and the rivalry between the Senate and the plebs, the conquest of Italy, the wars against Carthage, the overseas expansion, figures like Scipio, Marius, Sylla, Pompey and Caesar, and also life, religion, society, urbanism and warfare in Roman antiquity. In this second part, we go through the campaigns of Caesar, the transformation into an Empire under Augustus, the succession of emperors and the challenges they had to face, as well as the rise and persecution of Christianism until the new religion was adopted, the Roman economy, barbarian invasions, the separation of the empire into two parts and the final collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD.First part of the history of Ancient Rome: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaKyQ...ASMR story about Cleopatra: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UXnl...ASMR stoty about the Silk Road: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODPfc...All images under Creative Commons (source Wikipedia), video by The French Whisperer****************************************************My Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/thefrenchwhi...patreon: your contribution is very welcome.

    The History of North Sentinel Island - And Why it's Illegal to Visit
  ","With the killing of US Missionary John Allen Chau on the 25th November 2018, a small island in the Indian Ocean called North Sentinel Island became a household name - and his Neolithic, violently isolationist, tribal Sentinelese killers the subject of amazement and mystery. Having lived on their island for around 60,000, they are the modern population group we know the least about, every attempt to land on North Sentinel Island ending in an attack mounted by armed tribesmen on the beach. In this video I'll look at the history of the island and look at how modern events unfolding there can be of anthropological use when looking at the past.1991 Successful Friendly Landing on North Sentinel:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExdEH...Other Interesting Footage of Uncontacted Tribes in Papua New Guinea:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aV_8...Go Fund My Windmills (Patreon:)https://www.patreon.com/HistorywithHi...Join In The Banter On Twitter:https://twitter.com/HistorywHilbertEnter the Fray on Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/HistorywHilb...Music Used:Expeditionary - Kevin MacLeodFiresong - Kevin MacLeodNight of the Owl - Kevin MacLeodLoopster - Kevin MacLeodEastern Thought - Kevin MacLeodLost Frontier - Kevin MacLeodFeral Dub - Kevin MacLeod""Feral Dub” - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 LicenseSend me an email if you'd be interested in doing a collaboration! historywithhilbert@gmail.com#NorthSentinelIsland #USMissionaryKilled #UncontactedTribe",history

  ","In which John Green teaches you about one of the least funny subjects in history: slavery. John investigates when and where slavery originated, how it changed over the centuries, and how Europeans and colonists in the Americas arrived at the idea that people could own other people based on skin color. Slavery has existed as long as humans have had civilization, but the Atlantic Slave Trade was the height, or depth, of dehumanizing, brutal, chattel slavery. American slavery ended less than 150 years ago. In some parts of the world, it is still going on. So how do we reconcile that with modern life?

It follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and a squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.The film received universal critical acclaim, winning several awards for film, cast, and crew, as well as earning significant returns at the box office. The film grossed US$481.8 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of the year. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated the film for 11 Academy Awards; Spielberg's direction won him a second Academy Award for Best Director, with four more awards going to the film. Saving Private Ryan was released on home video in May 1999, earning another $44 million from sales. In 2014, Saving Private Ryan was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry as it was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""",history

  ","In this first episode we go back to the very beginning of human life of Britain.Note: The exact identity of the human species found at Happisburgh is a little more up in the air than this video makes it sound. Currently academic consensus looks to be moving towards Homo antecessor as the correct identity, however the stone tools found at Pakefield and Boxgrove are almost certainly from Homo heidelbergensis. This was simplified to Homo heidelbergensis in the video for the sake of brevity.

We first learn of the Zulu as a minor tribe of the Bantu people, living in South Africa. Shaka Zulu, the man who would organize them into an empire, was born the illegitimate son of a Zulu king. He was sent away with his mother Nandi to grow up in her tribe, the Langeni, but he eventually caught the attention of Dingiswayo, the leader of another powerful tribe called the Mtethwa. Appointed as the leader of a squadron called an ibutho, Shaka developed new tactics including a short ""iklwa"" fighting spear and a simple but effective military maneuever called ""the Bull Horn."" When his father died, Shaka - now a successful military leader - returned with Dingiswayo's backing to assassinate the rightful heir and assume control of his native tribe. Just a year later, though, the neighboring Ndwandwe tribe murdered Dingiswayo and Shaka vowed revenge on their leader, Zwide. He then launched a bloody war that, combined with the strains created by European colonization, led to the Mefacane, or the Crushing.____________Get the intro music here!http://bit.ly/1EQA5N7   *Music by Demetori: http://bit.ly/1AaJG4HListen to the outro music here!http://bit.ly/1L6ihlE__________Extra History - England: South Sea BubbleThe Sharp Mind of John Blunt: http://bit.ly/1BFMKocExtra Credits - Why Mechanics Must Be Both Good and AccurateHistorical Games: http://bit.ly/1EKo1Nn",history

Cannabis Sativa is an annual plant in the Cannabaceae family. It is a herb that has been used throughout recorded history by humans as a source of fiber, for its seed oil, as food, as medicine and for spiritual purposes.

    Idiot Mistakes That Changed The Course Of History
  ","Mistakes happen. Sometimes, truly idiotic mistakes happen that result in awful consequences, like centuries of persecution and racial hatred. But other times, idiotic mistakes can be a force for good. Just be glad you didn't cause these problems.The French Revolution was a bloody period in France's past where lots of unrest led to lots use of the guillotine. King Louis XVI took a final trip to the dreaded device in 1793, Marie Antoinette followed a few months later, and France changed forever.Their deaths kicked off the Reign of Terror and led to thousands of executions and the rise of Napoleon. But here's the thing they didn't need to die at all, and probably wouldn't have if Louis XVI hadn't made a whole series of dumb decisions.It started when thousands of people stormed the Bastille in July of 1789 looking for weapons. In October they captured the royals, but they weren't locked up; Louis and Marie Antoinette both could have walked out the door any time, but they simply didn't. It wasn't until around two years later that they finally snuck out, but despite having years to plan, they planned their escape pretty impractically. They traveled together in a large, conspicuous wagon laden with things like a complete dinner service and wine chest, and Louis sent away the one person who probably could have helped them: his wife's lover, Count Axel Fersen. Not surprisingly, the royals were captured again after being easily recognized along the way thanks, in part, to poor disguises and the fact they loved to socialize. Then, Fersen organized an escape with help from Sweden's king, broke into the palace, and hung out with Marie for a day until Louis sent him away again. Following some other ups and downs, the king was sent to the guillotine about a year later.

    The Biggest Lies Told in History
  ","From legends about George Washington to historical monuments, here are the Biggest Lies told in History.  Subscribe to American Eye http://goo.gl/GBphkv10. Columbus Discovered America9. Paul Revere8. 13 Colonies7. Washington Cherry Tree6. The Crossing of the Delaware5. Van Gogh Cut off EarWhile in school, learning about famous artists, we all know that Van Gogh was simply a mad man who sliced off his ear and mailed it to his lover, right? Who would really inflict that much physical pain on themselves over an ex? After looking through quite a few letters and it seems more than likely that him and a friend of his got into a scuffle involving too much French wine and a sword. Which normally don’t mix too well. Van Gogh was certainly no snitch and didn’t want to report the incident that could potentially put his best friend in prison. 4. Sphinx NoseHow did the Sphinx lose it’s nose? Did it get a bad Rhinoplasty?  Or was While Napoleon was invading Egypt, he used the nose as a target practice for his cannons. This is another absurd historical legend that many still might believe. The nose was gone centuries before Napoleon was even born. Napoleon was fascinated with Egyptology and sought to preserve egypt’s antiquities. The limestone used to construct the sphinx eroded fairly quickly after a few thousand years had gone by. But Egypt is a Muslim country where worshipping idols is not permitted and it’s still a wonder how this monument is still here. Historical accounts from the 1400’s say that a religious islamist leader, Muhammad Sa’im al Dahr, destroyed the nose when he saw people worshipping the sphinx as an idol. 3. Vikings Horned HelmetsArchaeologists have a better chance of finding a unicorn than finding a horned viking helmet. Even the football team the Vikings, have horns on their helmet. This is just a modern day myth and an artist's portrayal of how the vikings actually looks while in battle. Thiss portrayal began in the 1800’s when scandinavians artists such as Malmstrom and Mary McGregor included this style of helmet, like we see in this illustration of Leif Ericsson discovering Vineland. Horned helmets did exist but these were over a couple thousand of years ago during the bronze age and used for ritualistic religious ceremonies2. StonehengeOne of the biggest ancient mysteries in the world is certainly stonehenge and they’ve been standing in that formation for 5000 years. Oh no don’t tell me this is a lie too. Could this all be some kind of cruel hoax? Historical records of the monument date back to about 1200 AD but it’s highly doubtful that they’ve been in the same position we see them today.  A curator from Cambridge University quoted,”Nearly all the stones we see today have been moved in some way and are standing in concrete.” This image we see here shows stonehenge in 1877 with stones leaning on eachother. Many monuments around the world must be restored at some point. This photo here shows some type of restoration project going on in 1898 with two men on top of a block that looks like it’s being placed there with a crane.  This photo shows the crane picking up the block and you can clearly tell this is a massive restoration project. Take a look at the photos and let us know what you believe. 1. First ThanksgivingSorry Guys, American eye has to ruin thanksgiving for you too. And there’s absolutely no truth to this one besides the feast itself and what we celebrate couldn’t be anything further from the truth! As a kid you might have believed your teacher saying that thanksgiving was a friendly celebration between Indians and Pilgrims who came together and feasted on Turkey legs and corn, sharing farming secrets. Thanksgiving was basically a celebration after a vengeful retaliation on native americans and it was celebrated around the same time each year. We won’t get into all the details but if you know how history tended to go between European settlers and Native Americans, you can probably take a good guess. Anyways, don’t let it keep you from enjoying some stuffing and turkey, which the pilgrims never ate",history

    The Coming War On China (China Documentary) | History Documentary | Reel Truth History
  ","The Coming War on China, from award winning journalist John Pilger, reveals what the news doesn’t – that the world’s greatest military power, the United States, and the world’s second economic power, China, both nuclear-armed, may well be on the road to war. Nuclear war is not only imaginable, but planned. The greatest build-up of NATO military forces since the Second World War is under way on the western borders of Russia. On the other side of the world, the rise of China is viewed in Washington as a threat to American dominance. To counter this, President Obama announced a ‘pivot to Asia’, which meant that almost two-thirds of all US naval forces would be transferred to Asia and the Pacific, their weapons aimed at China. A policy which has been taken up by his successor Donald Trump, who during his election campaign said “We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country and that’s what they’re doing”.Filmed on five possible front-lines across Asia and the Pacific over two years, the story is told in chapters that connect a secret and ‘forgotten’ past to the rapacious actions of great power today and to a resistance, of which little is known in the West.Distributed by Sideways FilmsTo be the first to watch more full length documentaries, subscribe here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb7x...Welcome to Reel Truth History, the home of gripping and powerful documentaries.

    The Unfortunate History of the AMC Pacer - Documentary Film
  ","Behind all the jokes and insults, the AMC Pacer is actually a car with a great deal of history.  It began as radical new design from an underdog company.  In an attempt to combat the big, bland, boxy cars from Detroit's ""Big Three,"" little American Motors Corporation decided to build something a little different.  Their one-eyed car stylist Dick Teague proposed a small, wide car with big windows and smooth aerodynamics.  Americans had never seen anything like it. This in-depth documentary tells the true story of the Pacer.  Unbeknownst to many, the car persevered through manufacturing setbacks, government regulations, and many other troubles.  Featuring a ton of old car advertisements and rare footage of AMC's factory, the film helps paint a picture of the Pacer's world.  Director Joe Ligo sits down with AMC stylist Vincent Geraci, author Patrick Foster, and television personalities John Davis and Pat Goss from PBS's MotorWeek.",history

    Top 10 Most Famous Lesbians in History
  ","Top 10 Most Famous Lesbians and Feminists in HistoryLesbian relationship isn’t something that surprises people anymore. If couples have to hide even in 2017, what must it have been like a few years ago, when the LGBT community didn't understand their sexuality themselves? The LGBT community owes a lot to the men and women who came before them, knew how society felt about them, and yet, chose to love a member of the same sex openly.10. Josephine BakerJosephine Baker (1906 – 1975) American-born French dancer, singer, and actor, was known by many monikers, such as the “Black Pearl,” “Bronze Venus,” and “Creole Goddess.” She was the first black woman to star in a major film, Zouzou. She married four times, and her adopted son Jean-Claude Baker describes his mother as a bisexual, and recalled his mother as having many “lady lovers.”9. Frida KahloFrida Kahlo de Rivera (1907 – 1954), was a Mexican painter known for her self-portraits. Much has been written about Kahlo, with her works being celerated by feminists for its depiction of the female experience and form. 8. Amrita Sher-GillAmrita Sher-Gil (1913 –1941) was an eminent Indian painter, sometimes known as India's Frida Kahlo. Her affairs with men and women were quite well known, with her using some of them as models for her work. In fact, her work Two Women is considered to be a painting of herself with her lover Marie Louise.7. Billie Jean KingBillie Jean King (born November 22, 1943) is an American former World No. 1 professional tennis player. She was the first prominent female athlete to reveal her sexuality, when details of her affair with her secretary, Marilyn Barnett, was made public.6. Virginia WoolfAdeline Virginia Woolf (1882 – 1941) was an English writer and one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century. Woolf had a passionate relationship with Vita Sackville-West. This relationship inspired one of Woolf's most famous novels, Orlando , featuring the life of a poet who changes sex from man to woman over centuries, meeting the key figures of English literary history.5. Audre LordeAudre Lorde (1934 – 1992) was a black writer, feminist, womanist, and civil rights activist. She described herself as a “black, lesbian, mother, warrior, poet,” and was known for her activist work with Afro-German women in the 1980s.4. Barbara GittingsBarbara Gittings (1932 – 2007) was a prominent American activist for gay equality. Gittings served as the President of the New York chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis, picketed the White House in the 1960s to let the world know how easily homosexuals could be fired simply on the basis of their sexual orientation.3. Jane AddamsJane Addams known as the ""mother"" of Social Work (1860 – 1935) was a pioneer American settlement activist/reformer, social worker, sociologist, author, and leader in women's suffrage and world peace. She co-founded Hull House in 1889 with her first romantic partner Ellen Gates Starr. Addams was later in a relationship with Mary Rozet Smith, who was financially sound, and supported Addams's work at Hull House. Addams won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931.2. Queen Christina of SwedenChristina (1626 – 1689) reigned as Queen of Sweden from 1632 to 1654. Queen Christina rejected the role of a woman, which was simply to provide an heir, by announcing that she did not intend to marry. Modern biographers generally consider her to have been a lesbian, with many affairs with women noted during her life. Sources have found passionate letters to Ebba Sparre, and she was supposed to have had relationships with Gabrielle de Rochechouart de Mortemart, Rachel, a niece of Diego Teixeira and the singer Angelina Giorgino.1. SapphoSappho (c. 630 – c. 570 BC) was an archaic Greek poet from the island of Lesbos. The word “lesbian” is literally derived from the Greek island of Lesbos, where Sappho was born. Sappho's poetry was lyric poetry, and she is best known for her poems about love. Her poems spoke of the infatuations and love, both requited and unrequited, she felt for other women.Music: Greko Sketch by Kevin MacLeod from YouTube Audio LibraryOur Facebook Page http://fb.me/BestTop10Videos",history

    PHILIPPINES: The Hidden History of Ancient Kingdoms and Empires
  ","-This video is not an Anti-Hispanic culture documentary and doesn't aim to abolished Hispanic/American culture in Philippines, I think it's important to remember that we need to appreciate every collective culture that history has throwned to the islands of the Philippines, for it would be a monument of the richness of the country, to remind every Filipinos that many great nations with different cultures of the world have fought for it's richness but in the end it was taken back by the Filipino people, and the Filipino people alone. That way they can feel a sense of uniqueness among the other Asian cultures! i don't want this video to be misunderstoodplus it could make Spain and America get away with everything they did while colonizing The Philippines, if Filipinos just erase the culture as if that part of history never happened. I personally saw it happening today. Some Spanish or even Mexican and Americans people today are rejecting the fact that they did colonized Philippines at all. Why? because Filipinos are destroying every evidence of it from their cultures and architectures[for more info watch: https://goo.gl/eN6Xnk ] thinking they belong to Asia when that is not the case! Colonial era is already part of Philippine history! and no matter what, history will never change! European cultures is already passed to Philippines and you cannot forced it not to.Colonial history is the only part of history that has a direct contact with the pre-colonial era as it is the sequel of the story,...  if the rejection of colonial evidence(demolishing many heritage cities instead of rebuilding a replicating it) still continues, even history of colonization might even be rejected as a myth and this is very possible.This Video only aims to let them appreicate the lost Pre-Hispanic cultures too.The Lost History of Ancient Philippine Kingdoms and Empires, Unknown to present day mainstream Philippine Education. Buried by the destructive sands of time and Sunken by the war waging seas of fate, lies a paradise of melting cultures, The Pearl of the Orient. facebook: https://web.facebook.com/Bring-Back-T...Dubbed by: The Shadow Parliamenthttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmJH...Edited by: Kero SceneP.S. It's time for Fiilipino's to trace back history and use it! and give it a priority!! From the time of Negritos, to the arrival of Austronesians to the Ming dynasty to the Arab and Indian era to Spanish and American Colonization, and to the World War 2 and so on! Filipino culture and History is very beautiful you only need to realize it.Update: this is not a Chinese propaganda, this video does not claim that China originally owns Philippines including spratlys. watch the whole thing![Also Watch old Manila heritage story:https://goo.gl/eN6Xnk Warsaw,Poland(the most damaged city in the world) did replicated it's old beauty and build their heritage structure authentically, so why not Manila? every other city in Metro Manila should be modern with tall skyscrapers like BGC, they're just new cities anyway! but The City of Manila is very very old with a lots of stories to tell, the city should be where we see a glimpse of beautiful past.]i do not own this",history

As a young man, he treated many patients during the cholera epidemic that struck Newcastle. He noticed that the traditional explanation for cholera's spread - miasma from graveyards and swamps - could not explain its appearance in Newcastle where he treated patients. He took that knowledge with him to London, where he formally studied medicine and achieved the highest honors in his profession in only a year. His formal study of anesthesia earned him such great recognition that on two occasions he was trusted to work on the Queen. But then cholera broke out in London again. Snow wanted to prove miasma didn't cause it and find the real cause, so he interviewed patients and doctors across the city. He theorized that the diarrhea which came from cholera also helped to spread it. He even wrote up a case study where one street whose well water mixed with sewage had a huge infection rate while across the street their neighbors with pure well water barely suffered at all. Confident that he had found the cause, he published his findings, but the medical community was not thoroughly convinced.____________Get the intro music here!http://bit.ly/1EQA5N7   *Music by Demetori: http://bit.ly/1AaJG4HGet the outro music here!http://bit.ly/1iYzuEx   *Music by Sean and Dean Kiner: http://bit.ly/1LBy9zh__________Extra History - Warring States Japan: Sengoku JidaiBattle of Okehazama: http://bit.ly/1IUpYw2Extra Credits - What Type of Player are You?Bartle's Taxonomy: http://bit.ly/1LSrtIx",history

  ","Space is hard. There’s a reason we use rocket science as a benchmark for anything extremely difficult. I for one champion all things space and eagerly await every single upcoming space event. But, in order to move forward, we’d better look back at some past failures and see what we’ve learned from them.What better way to do that than to watch some of the biggest boom’s in spaceflight history? BUT as always on my channel, this isn’t just a random compilation of crazy explosions, nope sorry… I’ll be teaching you what went wrong and other random facts about each mission so we too can learn while we watch some fireworks….After all, mistakes are only mistakes if you don’t learn anything from them. That being said, let’s see some of the biggest booms in rocket history!12: SpaceX landing attempts (2015)11: SM-65 Atlas, 6/11/195710: Titan 1, 12/12/19599: Atlas/Centaur 5, 3/2/19658: Falcon 9 / Amos 6, 9/1/20167: Antares / CRS ORB-3, 10/28/20146: Juno II / Explorer S-1, 7/16/19595: Ariane 5, 6/4/19964: Proton / GLONASS, 7/2/20133: Titan IV / A-20, 8/12/982 Delta II / GPS IIR-1, 1/17/19971: N1 / L1 ZOND, 7/3/1968Rockets in Everyday Places - https://youtu.be/cLJkk-iHr8QMatt Travis ""It's gonna get loud"" footage - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZ0Sg...Antares failure from Elliot Severn - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9yth...Amos - 6 - http://uslaunchreport.comFollow and Like my new series on Facebook Watch with Space.com ""Spacing Out!"" - https://www.facebook.com/SpacingOutEv...My second place Tesla commercial ""Spaceships.

    Darius I and The Greatest Lie in History
  ","In our new animated historical documentary we will talk about the king of the Achaemenid Empire Darius I and his ascension to the throne. Assassination, intrigue and cover-ups, what more could we want in a story about Imperial succession? The First Persian Empire was one of the greatest and most labyrinthine empires that ever existed. An expertly organised economy, a relatively tolerant and lenient provincial system, along with other groundbreaking advances in human civilisation was combined with some of the most scandalous and bloody court politics in the history of the world. Much of ancient Persia’s prominence and prosperity was made possible by one man, perhaps the most competent ruler Persia ever produced - Darius I, or ‘the Great’. How this figure came to power is not a well known story, but it is one of the most obscure and colourful tales we can gather from the ancient sources. Welcome to our video on Darius the Great and how he rose to become the King of Kings.

    American History Textbooks' Lies: Everything Your Teacher Got Wrong - Myths, Education (1995)
  ","Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong is a 1995 book by sociologist James W. Loewen. More about the book: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/074...It critically examines twelve American history textbooks and concludes that textbook authors propagate factually false, Eurocentric, and mythologized views of history. In addition to critiquing the dominant historical themes presented in textbooks, Loewen presents a number of his own historical themes that he says are ignored by traditional history textbooks. A newly revised and updated hardcover edition was released on April 1, 2008. The New Press lists Lies My Teacher Told Me as its top all-time bestseller.In Lies My Teacher Told Me, Loewen criticizes modern American history textbooks for containing incorrect information about people and events such as Christopher Columbus, the lies and inaccuracies in the history books regarding the dealings between the Europeans and the Native Americans, and their often deceptive and inaccurate teachings told about America's commerce in slavery. He further criticizes the texts for a tendency to avoid controversy and for their ""bland"" and simplistic style. He proposes that when American history textbooks elevate American historical figures to the status of heroes, they unintentionally give students the impression that these figures are superhumans who live in the irretrievable past. In other words, the history-as-myth method teaches students that America's greatest days have already passed. Loewen asserts that the muting of past clashes and tragedies makes history boring to students, especially groups excluded from the positive histories.The twelve textbooks Loewen examined for the first edition are:The American Adventure (1975)American Adventures (1987)American History (1982)The American Pageant (1991)The American Tradition (1984)The American Way (1979)The Challenge of Freedom (1990)Discovering American History (1974)Land of Promise (1983)Life and Liberty (1984)Triumph of the American Nation (1986)The United States: A History of the Republic (1991)In the second edition, Loewen added six more books; including a newer edition of The American Pageant:The American Journey (2000)The American Pageant (2006)The Americans (2007)America: Pathways to the Present (2005)A History of the United States (2005)Holt American Nation (2003)Lies my Teacher Told Me is the winner of the 1996 American Book Award,[3] the Oliver Cromwell Cox Award for Distinguished Anti-Racist Scholarship, and the Critics Choice Award of the American Educational Studies Association. Sundown Towns was named one of ten Distinguished Books of 2005 by the Gustavus Myers Foundation.Conservative activist David Horowitz has criticized some of Loewen's assertions for their partiality and inaccuracy, in particular questioning Loewen's claims about the relationship between American Indians and Columbus.Lies My Teacher Told Me is mentioned in the novel Deadline by Chris Crutcher.Lies My Teacher Told Me is mentioned in the liner notes of the Rise Against album, The Sufferer & the Witness.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_...",history

    Historical Figures How They Really Looked | Amazing 3D Facial Reconstruction
  ","► Historical Figures How They Really Looked | Amazing 3D Facial Reconstructions► Subscribe: https://goo.gl/Vn6TVoOne of the (few) ways that many of us can relate to the vast scope of history is from the visual angle. Research-based reconstructions certainly bring forth such an advantage with their provision of ‘glimpses’ into the past.

    The Jesus of History versus the Christ of Faith
  ","Sifting through centuries of mythmaking, Reza Aslan sheds new light on one of history’s most influential and enigmatic figures by examining Jesus within the context of the times in which he lived: the age of zealotry. Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against historical sources, Aslan describes a man of peace who exhorted his followers to arm themselves; an exorcist and faith healer who urged his disciples to keep his identity secret; and the seditious “King of the Jews,” whose promise of liberation from Rome went unfulfilled in his lifetime. Aslan explores why the early Church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary and grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself.Speaker: Reza Aslan",history

  ","Earth had a climate long before we showed up and started noticing it and it's influenced by a whole series of cycles that have been churning along for hundreds of millions of years. In most cases those cycles will continue long after we're gone. A look at the history of climate change on Earth can give us some much needed perspective on our current climate dilemma because the surprising truth is, what we're experiencing now is different than anything this planet has encountered before. So, let's take a stroll down Climate History Lane and see if we can find some answers to a question that's been bugging Hank a lot lately - just how much hot water are we in?Like SciShow?

Once in a while a cap is placed on the amount of time allowed, and obviously televised matches need to fit within a designated timeslot, but most of the time, wrestlers are able to continue grappling until someone is pinned and a winner is declared.However, on the other end of the spectrum, the shortest amount of time possible for a wrestling match is three seconds - just enough time for the referee to count off the pin. Through distractions, quickly gained advantages, and devastating finishers, a couple matches have actually lasted for only the minimum length, with a number of other notable bouts coming quite close.

    The Biggest Scandals To Ever Hit The History Channel
  ","Back when the internet was young and facts still had meaning, there was the History Channel, featuring shows about - you guessed it - history. But that version of the network is long gone today. Here are the biggest scandals to hit the reality TV outlet that's now simply called History.Ice Road Truckers is one of History's best-known reality shows, depicting the perilous lives of drivers in the iciest regions of Canada and Alaska. And sure, it's been criticized by actual trucker media like Truck News for exaggerating or even faking some of the danger.But real scandal hit the show in 2013. According to a CBS report, star Tim Zickuhr abducted Lisa Cadeau after hiring her for escort work in Las Vegas. He claimed she overcharged him by $1,000 and demanded she meet him to settle the dispute. It was then that he dragged her back to his apartment, beat her, and tied her up in a closet.Fearing for her life, Cadeau gave Zickuhr the phone number of an undercover police officer, claiming he could pay her ransom. Zickuhr called the number and unknowingly arranged his own arrest. The Las Vegas Sun reported Zickuhr confessed on the spot that he intended to hold Cadeau hostage and prostitute her through Craigslist.Watch the video for more about The Biggest Scandals To Ever Hit The History Channel.#History #HistoryChannel #ScandalIce Road Truckers | 0:15The Kennedys | 1:21Swamp People | 2:19Bigfoot Captured | 3:07Hunting Hitler | 3:57Amelia Earhart | 4:44American Pickers | 5:47The Bible | 6:25Alone | 7:17Mountain Men | 8:15Ax Men | 9:22Pawn Stars | 10:30",history

The biopic stars Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, a female mathematician, philosopher and astronomer in late 4th-century Roman Egypt, who investigates the flaws of the geocentric Ptolemaic system and the heliocentric model that challenges it. Surrounded by religious turmoil and social unrest, Hypatia struggles to save the knowledge of classical antiquity from destruction. Max Minghella co-stars as Davus, Hypatia's father's slave, and Oscar Isaac as Hypatia's student, and later prefect of Alexandria, Orestes.The story uses historical fiction to highlight the relationship between religion and science amidst the decline of Greco-Roman polytheism and the Christianization of the Roman Empire. The title of the film takes its name from the agora, a gathering place in ancient Greece, similar to the Roman forum. The film was produced by Fernando Bovaira and shot on the island of Malta from March to June 2008. Justin Pollard, co-author of The Rise and Fall of Alexandria (2007), was the historical adviser for the film.Agora was screened out of competition at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival in May, and opened in Spain on October 9, 2009 becoming the highest grossing film of the year for that country. Although the film had difficulty finding distribution, it was released country by country throughout late 2009 and early 2010. The film received a 53% overall approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes and seven Goya Awards in Spain, including Best Original Screenplay. It was awarded the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Feature Film Prize at the Hamptons International Film Festival.",history

Well, the stuff you've heard about them may not be true. The Vikings weren't just pagan raiders striking terror into the hearts of defenseless European Christendom. They were some of the greatest travelers of their time, and they weren't always traveling to steal. In a lot of cases, they were traveling to trade. John will teach you about Viking trade goods, Norse Mythology, and yes, there will be blood, guts, and dragons.

It turns out, Iran has a pretty long history of unrest in order to put power in the hands of the people, and the most recent revolution in 1979 was, at least at first, not necessarily about creating an Islamic state. It certainly turned out to be about that, but it was initially just about people who wanted to get rid of an oppressive regime.

  ","Support CaspianReport through Patreon:https://www.patreon.com/CaspianReportIn the 14th century a Muslim historian named Ibn Khaldun wrote about the pattern of history. Farmers would build irrigation systems supporting villages and towns. Later some warrior would bring these towns under his rule and form a united political entity, like a kingdom or an empire. Then a tribe of nomads would come along and conquer the kingdom, seize all the holdings and settle in their place and further expand the new empire. As time went by the nomads would assimilate and become soft city dwellers. Exactly the kind of people they had conquered and at this point another tribe of nomads would come along and conquer them and take their empire.

And it really only goes back about a century, to the early 1900s.

To heal ourselves so that we can heal others. Not as separate parts, but as a whole sum of Humanity!This video has now been seen in 190+ countries!Still people don't seem to be getting the point.I am a human being just as you. Doing things for the right reasons just as you.If you're not treating your fellow man (Mankind) (Human Beings) with compassion, or at least treating them as you would be treated, then how are you helping the situation.And if you're not helping the situation, then what are you doing?Its not about invisible lines that divide us rather human qualities that unit us.It's a lie to think your not good enough. There are two entities in the world.1. Evil This is where one feels Anger, Jealousy, Greed, Resentment, Lies, and Inferiority.2. Goodness This is where one feels Joy, Peace, Love, Hope, Humility, Kindness, Empathy and Truth.As I read over the comments I see both Evil and Goodness shared. It is not a country that is evil or good. Rather it is a personal choice of the people in any country to be either Good or Evil. And they do so through their actions.",history

    Imperialism: Crash Course World History #35
  ","In which John Green teaches you about European Imperialism in the 19th century. European powers started to create colonial empires way back in the 16th century, but businesses really took off in the 19th century, especially in Asia and Africa. During the 1800s, European powers carved out spheres of influence in China, India, and pretty much all of Africa. While all of the major (and some minor) powers in Europe participated  in this new imperialism, England was by far the most dominant, once able to claim that the ""sun never set on the British Empire."" Also, they went to war for the right to continue to sell opium to the people of China. Twice. John will teach you how these empires managed to leverage the advances of the Industrial Revolution to build vast, wealth-generating empires. As it turns out, improved medicine, steam engines, and better guns were crucial in the 19th century conquests. Also, the willingness to exploit and abuse the people and resources of so-called ""primitive"" nations was very helpful in the whole enterprise.

    The Most Shocking Endings In Movie History
  ","Seeing the characters we've spent a whole movie getting to know ride off into the sunset might be a great feeling, but sometimes a greater thrill can be found in a good shock. Luckily, there are plenty of writers and directors who are adept at leaving audiences utterly speechless as the credits roll. Massive spoilers ahead.Bryan Singer's neo-noir classic The Usual Suspects follows the interrogation of seemingly helpless Roger ""Verbal"" Kint, one of only two survivors of a devastating fire on a ship docked at the Port of Los Angeles. Kevin Spacey's character spins the detectives and viewers a long and twisted tale of drugs, deceit and death, explaining that everything comes back to a mysterious mob boss by the name of Keyser Söze. The twist? Kint was Keyser Söze all along, which the officers realize only a few moments too late. As Kint exits the police station and shuffles off down the street, his awkward gait starts to straighten out - and we realize we've been had.Watch the video for more about the most shocking endings in movie history.#TwistEndings #ShockingEndingsThe Usual Suspects | 0:19Inglourious Basterds | 0:59The Planet of the Apes | 1:51Orphan | 2:41The Empire Strikes Back | 3:22Seven | 4:09The Departed | 4:40Shutter Island | 5:24Into The Wild | 6:09The Perks of Being a Wallflower | 6:55The Mist | 7:41The Sixth Sense | 8:25The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas | 9:23Psycho | 10:03",history

They describe Nibiru as many times the diameter of Earth, and abundant with iron oxide, making its rivers and lakes appear red. A side note about Nibiru:  according to the Sumerian tablets, Nibiru’s atmosphere began to deteriorate and became a hostile place for life, and in order to restore it, the Annunaki needed one important element for their atmosphere:  gold.Music: Kevin Macleod - Rites (Royalty Free)Written and Narrated by Elisabeth Firestone: info@BestNarrator.comScenes from the following productions were used under Fair Use for educational purposes:History Channel's Ancient Aliens PBS NOVA's Secrets of Noah's Ark 2015 Ancient Sumerian History and Anunnaki Culture - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8sLX...

    A Brief History of Pi
  ","Get 10% off Squarespace by following this link: http://squarespace.com/simonclarkCheck out my new website here! https://www.simonoxfphys.com/Note that there's a huge amount about pi that I didn't cover in this video due to time - I didn't even mention proofs of it being irrational and transcendental, or why we call it pi! I chose to focus on the development of its approximation as a hook to teach the broader history of mathematics, rather than make this video an exhaustive list of facts. The wiki is a great place to learn more about the rest of the number's history and applications in maths and physics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#History A few nitpicky things:- I made mistakes distinguishing between 'digits of pi calculated' and 'decimal points of pi calculated' in some sections, so it is possible that this error is elsewhere without me knowing.- Archimedes didn't do his approximation with squares, he started with hexagons and then increased the order of the polygon. I chose to present the zeroth order version of his algorithm using squares for simplicity, but note that this is not what he did.- Something which got lost from the final version of this video is my argument that during the Age of Enlightenment pi shifted from being a physical (measured) constant to a purely logical (theoretical) one. This then embodies the philosophical shift in society at the time.

    History of Jailbreaking
  ","basically, jailbreaking is a type of “privilege escalation.” Now that’s a pretty technical term so let me break it down. User privilege refers to how much access a user has to any given system, in this case iOS. And when you jailbreak your iPhone, you gain additional access to parts of the operating system that were previously restricted – so you’re achieving an escalated level of privilege on your device, so privilege escalation. And this is usually achieved by exploiting some kind of design flaw or bug in the operating system. So to sum it up, jailbreaking is a way for users to do a lot more with their iPhone than what was previously possible.The term “jailbreaking” originated with iOS, which began pretty much as soon as iPhones were released, but it’s been used to describe privilege escalation in other systems as well, like Playstation. Similar tools have been developed for other systems in recent years. For example, “rooting” became a popular process among Android phone and tablet users to escalate privileges on those devices. Thanks to a huge community of hackers, developers, and coders that love to tinker with technology, there’s been a way to jailbreak pretty much every iteration of iOS within a short time of their release.",history

    Rewriting human history
  ","The latest discoveries  the 1.77-million-year-old skeletons of three adults and a teenager  have legs and feet adapted for long-distance walking and running, similar to those of modern humans, but have hands and arms similar to those of our tree-dwelling ancestors. The ancient Dmanisi inhabitants, who have some human features and some ape-like features, share characteristics with both Homo erectus, originally thought to be the first Homo species to migrate from Africa to Europe, and Homo habilis, the oldest species with human attributes found in Africa. Dr Lordkipanidze and his team of researchers reckon that the Dmanisi individuals were 1.45- to 1.66-metre-tall meat-eaters who probably slept in trees at night for safety.The latest findings, which also raise questions about the evolution of Homo sapiens and about migration out of Africa, were revealed in a major article in Nature magazine in September 2007, written by Lordkipanidze and his team of European and American researchers.Dmanisi is not only the oldest site outside Africa, but also the most prolific  a treasure trove of prehistoric archaeology, says Lordkipanidze, who is director of the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi.Only 5 per cent of the 13,000-square-metre site at Dmanisi has been excavated and, for much of the time since the archaeological work began in earnest in 1991, it was protected only by a plastic tarpaulin roof. Now, partly with the funding from his Rolex Award, Lordkipanidze and his colleagues have had a dome built over the site to protect it from the weather and from looting.",history

By way of providing context for this, John also talks a bit about wider America in the 1950s. The 1950s are a deeply nostalgic period for many Americans, but there is more than a little idealizing going on here. The 1950s were a time of economic expansion, new technologies, and a growing middle class. America was becoming a suburban nation thanks to cookie-cutter housing developments like the Levittowns.  While the white working class saw their wages and status improve, the proverbial rising tide wasn't lifting all proverbial ships. A lot of people were excluded from the prosperity of the 1950s. Segregation in housing and education made for some serious inequality for African Americans. As a result, the Civil Rights movement was born. John will talk about the early careers of Martin Luther King, Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, and even Earl Warren. He'll teach you about Brown v Board of Education, and the lesser known Mendez vs Westminster, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and all kinds of other stuff.Crash Course World History is now available on DVD!

France endured multiple constitutions, the heads of heads of state literally rolled, and then they ended up with a megalomaniacal little emperor by the name of Napoleon.

    HISTORY OF RELIGION (Part 1): PAGANS, NIMROD, & BABYLON
  ","In order to understand the many lies that have given to us over time, we must be educated on the truth.  A main part of my ministry is to educate so that lies can be truly seen and bondage be broken.  Many people are against Christianity for many reasons, but one of the biggest reasons is they don't understand the history behind it.  So my next series of videos will be educating my viewers on the history of religion. In an effort to keep the time down, it's just a summary so if there is something left out or that you don't understand leave it in the comments and I will try to answer if I can.  I hope this blesses whoever watched.  The Lord says his people suffer for a lack of knowledge and my goal is to try and stop the suffering.Sources:Book of JasherCompendium of World History Vol 1.

    A Vanishing History: Gullah Geechee Nation
  ","On the Sea Islands along the coasts of South Carolina and Georgia, a painful chapter of American history is playing out again. These islands are home to the Gullah or Geechee people, the descendants of enslaved Africans who were brought to work at the plantations that once ran down the southern Atlantic coast. After the Civil War, many former slaves on the Sea Islands bought portions of the land where their descendants have lived and farmed for generations. That property, much of it undeveloped waterfront land, is now some of the most expensive real estate in the country.But the Gullah are now discovering that land ownership on the Sea Islands isn’t quite what it seemed. Local landowners are struggling to hold on to their ancestral land as resort developers with deep pockets exploit obscure legal loopholes to force the property into court-mandated auctions. These tactics have successfully fueled a tourism boom that now attracts more than 2 million visitors a year. Gullah communities have all but disappeared, replaced by upscale resorts and opulent gated developments that new locals — golfers, tourists, and mostly white retirees —  fondly call “plantations.”Faced with an epic case of déjà vu, the Gullah are scrambling for solutions as their livelihood and culture vanish, one waterfront mansion at a time.Subscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-NewsCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.comFollow VICE News here:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenewsTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenewsTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/Instagram: http://instagram.com/vicenewsMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideos",history

    Manufacturing plywood boards: then and now
  ","Plywood is a simple material made by glueing together thin sheets of wood, known as veneers or plies. These basic elements have remained broadly the same throughout its history. The most significant breakthrough in its production came in the early 1800s with the development of steam-powered machines that could cut veneers cheaply. The most influential of these was the rotary veneer cutter.The cutter rotates a log against a wide, horizontal blade, causing it to ‘peel’ into a continuous sheet of wood. This enables the creation of longer, wider sheets of veneer than previously possible and with little waste. Using these machines meant that plywood could be manufactured quickly and inexpensively on a large scale.This film shows the stages in manufacturing plywood boards in the mid-20th century and today. The process remains essentially unchanged, although today many of the machines are much faster and computer controlled. Produced as part of the V&A exhibition Plywood: Material of the Modern World (15 July – 12 November 2017) https://www.vam.ac.uk/plywoodSponsored by MADE.COM.

    PORSCHE 911 TURBO S Car Factory HOW IT'S MADE Manufacturing [FULL VIDEO Production]
  ","2018 Porsche 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series 607 HP Car Factory How it's made Manufacturing. In addition to a power increase of 27 hp, the 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series is distinct from the standard 911 Turbo S due to its unique design, higher-quality materials and luxurious details. ►If you love cars you should subscribe now to Gommeblog Car and Performance Youtube Channel: http://goo.gl/sP8oKKThe sports car is being intricately finished by hand in the new Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur at the headquarters in Zuffenhausen. Previously known as “Porsche Exclusive”, the in-house workshop specialises in tailoring to customer wishes, as well as being responsible for limited-edition series. And for the first time ever, Porsche customers can have the matching chronograph from Porsche Design configured in the same design as their sports car.Increased power and performanceThe 3.8-litre, six-cylinder biturbo flat engine with an exclusive power kit has a maximum torque of 750 Nm, delivering between 2,250 and 4,000 rpm. This means that the 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h in 2.9 seconds, and takes 9.6 seconds to cross the 200 km/h threshold. The sports car can reach a top speed of 330 km/h. Fuel consumption is the same as the standard model at 9.1 l/100 km combined. This corresponds to CO2 emissions of 212 g/km. The 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series comes with black-painted 20-inch wheels with central locking as standard, and their design lines are carefully finished in Golden Yellow Metallic using a new laser technology. For the first time, the brake callipers for the PCCB ceramic brake system are available ex works in a black-painted version with the Porsche logo in Golden Yellow Metallic. The active sports chassis with Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM) and the Sport Chrono package are included in the standard equipment. The rear-axle steering and Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) rolling-motion compensation improve handling and provide stability.How to make an Exceptional designWhat makes the 911 Turbo S Exclusive Series so distinctive is its exclusive Golden Yellow Metallic paint finish and the various components in carbon, like the bonnet, roof and side skirts. The two carbon-weave strips that contour the roof and bonnet accentuate the sporty look of the car. The rear view is characterised by the rear wing of the Turbo Aerokit, the new rear apron, the ram-air scoop in carbon and the exhaust system with two twin tailpipes made from stainless steel in black. The wings are decorated with Porsche Exclusive Manufaktur plates. In addition to Golden Yellow Metallic, the vehicle is offered in a range of other carefully selected exterior colours.I Love this 911: in my Top 10 new cars 2018""New 2017 Manufacturing, Porsche Car Factory, Plants review"" interior safety luxury car best production acceleration supercars",manufacturing

    SEAT Transmission Production in Barcelona – MQ281 Six-Speed Manual Gearbox Manufacturing
  ","▪ The SEAT Componentes plant is now making the MQ281 transmission▪ The maximum annual capacity of the new gearbox totals 450,000 units SEAT Componentes, one of the Spanish brand's three production centres together with Martorell and Barcelona, has begun production of the Volkswagen Group's new MQ281 gearbox. This new, six-speed gearbox will be used by the SEAT, Volkswagen, Audi and Škoda brands and its maximum throughput capacity amounts to 450,000 units annually.Production of the MQ281 gearbox is a recognition by the Volkswagen Group to the work carried out by SEAT Componentes in recent years to improve efficiency and increase productivity. Located in El Prat de Llobregat near the Barcelona airport, the plant stands out for being highly integrated and manufactures every aluminium part as well as gears and shafts, for which it has casting, machining, assembly and bench testing facilities. In 2018, it made close to 700,000 MQ200 model gearboxes and exported 56% of its output.According to SEAT Vice-president for Production and Logistics Dr. Christian Vollmer, “SEAT Componentes is a key plant for our company, and with the allocation of this project, for the Volkswagen Group as well. We will be able to raise the production ceiling with this new gearbox to up to 3,500 units daily, enabling us to maintain the plant as a benchmark centre in terms of efficiency, productivity and quality. Moreover, the MQ281 transmission cuts three grammes of CO2 emissions per km from each vehicle compared to a similar gearbox.”Thomas Schmall, Chairman of the Board of Management of Volkswagen Group Components, said: “The start of production of the new MQ281 reveals the advantages of our new Group Components unit. We use cross-brand hubs for the configuration of our plants and for production, creating the freedom and flexibility that we urgently need for the transformation to electric mobility.”SEAT Componentes, 40 years creating gearboxesSEAT Componentes is one of the nine facilities dedicated to making transmissions that the Volkswagen Group has all over the world together with the ones in Kassel (Germany), Vrchlabi and Mladá Boleslav (Czech Republic), Córdoba (Argentina) and Anting, Dalian, Tianjin and Changchun (China). It is staffed by over 1,000 employees and has a surface area of 155,000 square metres.With its newly optimised production lines, the plant currently has a maximum daily manufacturing capacity of 3,500 gearboxes, 300 more than prior to the start of production of the new MQ281. In addition to the new transmission, SEAT Componentes also makes the MQ200 gearbox. Together, the maximum annual output is now 800,000 gearboxes.Created in 1979, SEAT Componentes has been singled out on several occasions for its efficiency and the high quality of its production processes. From 2010 to 2013, the plant reorganised its production flows in order to increase capacity, productivity and quality, which led to the allocation of the new gearbox. In 2016, the plant was recognised with the Industrial Excellence Award for the excellence and efficiency of its lean management strategy, acknowledging it as a benchmark in terms of productivity and quality.",manufacturing

    Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing
  ","The patented Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) process uses the power of sound to merge layers of metal foil. The process produces true metallurgical bonds with full density and works with a variety of metals such as aluminum, copper, stainless steel, and titanium. In combining additive and subtractive process capabilities, UAM can create deep slots, hollow, latticed, or honeycombed internal structures, and other complex geometries impossible with conventional subtractive manufacturing processes.  Additionally, the solid state nature of the UAM bond allows for welding of dissimilar metals.  This enables dissimilar metal cladding, production of custom metal matrix composites, and the ability to embed objects or sensors in a metal substrate.   Through the use of UAM technology, customers will be able to manufacture complex parts that have unique features and attributes not possible using traditional manufacturing techniques. In addition, parts currently made with traditional operations can be made with much less waste, an increasingly important factor as more expensive, higher performance materials see broader use.",manufacturing

    WHAT ARE OEMs Original Equipment Manufacturers | OEM industrial spare parts
  ","Did you ever wonder how big companies are able to manufacture complex products such as: a computer, a smartphone or even a car? Thanks to OEMsWe can start by clarify the meaning of O-E-M. The acronym O-E-M means Original Equipment Manufacturers and it refers to those companies that produce parts or equipments that can be assembled on a finished product by another company, which provide to market the item with its own brand. This company is referred to as Parent company. The parent company is almost always bigger than the OEM companies.Let's take the example of vehicles. The majority of the assembled parts of a vehicles are produced by OEM suppliers.In fact, a car consists of a wide variety of components, most of which are not produced directly from the parent company.In many cases, the engine of a car can be manufactured by a OEM company specialized in manufacturing Engineering.Not to mention all the components composing the engine, such as: the battery, the control unit, the oil filter and many other mechanical, electrical and hydraulic components.Furthermore, a car needs wheels to move. The wheels are made of tires and alloy wheels, which can be produced by different companies.Passengers inside the car must be able to sit in a comfortable position, thanks to the seats that are often commissioned to OEM companies specialized in the production of car seats.Thanks to OEM companies specialized in the production of airbags or seatbelts that the passengers can travel safety.Windshield, rear window and side windows, but also the lights or even the mirrors or the radio antenna can be manufactured by OEMs. Very often OEM manufacturers sell the same components to several different car manufacturers.This, is a hydro steering gear as well as a perfect example of OEM. It is installed by automobile manufacturer BMW on its vehicles. However, this component is actually manufactured inside ZF Group factories, a German multinational company producing components for the transport industry. Now let's take the example of a computer or any other electronic devices resulting from the assembly of several components, such as: the motherboard and other electronic boards, the Central Processing unit, the cooling fans, or even the operating system as well as its installed software. They are all made by OEM manufacturers.Linkedin: https://it.linkedin.com/company/jaes-srlFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jaescompany/",manufacturing

    How to Find a Supplier on Alibaba & Find a Chinese Manufacturer
  ","This video tutorial will teach you how to find a supplier on Alibaba & find a Chinese manufacturer. ►► Free Ebook - Make $10,000/Month Online: http://wholesaleted.com/4-stepHere are our step-by-step instructions on how to find a supplier on Alibaba:Step 1: Go to Alibaba and find the search bar. Type in the name of a product that you are interested in selling. In this video I used vitamin pills as an example. Step 2: Because a lot of suppliers have duplicate listings on Alibaba for the same item (because it increases their presence in the Alibaba search engine) you will need to filter the results by clicking on “browse by suppliers.” Step 3: To filter the results down further, search by “Gold Suppliers.” Most suppliers will do this because it has become basically a prerequisite for having new buyers contact them. It doesn’t cost them much money to do this, so the results will only be filtered by a small amount. Step 4 (OPTIONAL): If the list of suppliers is still too long, then click to filter the results by “assessed supplier.” This is only necessary in very popular niches where you have a large number of suppliers that you need to filter down to a manageable amount. Step 5: Contact 10-20 suppliers at least. If you have time, then contact more. The more you contact, the better.Here is the email template referenced in our video tutorial on how to find a supplier on Alibaba: ""My name is [INSERT NAME] from [INSERT BUSINESS NAME]. Our company director asked me to contact your company about working together on a lucrative, long-term venture. We are a company that sells products related to [INSERT NICHE HERE] and we do over 2 million dollars in sales each year. We’re looking to expand our product range and create a profitable partnership between your company and ours.We are planning to purchase [INSERT ITEM] to our product line. It would need to meet these specifications: * Specification (e.g size)* Specification (e.g. quantity)* Specification (e.g. colour)We have been researching different companies in China that manufacture [INSERT ITEM] and we think that your company could be a great supplier for it. We would like to get some more information and have a few questions that we would like you to please answer: * Can we please get a sample of the product as soon as possible. Can you please let us know how much you will charge for the sample, including Express shipping to [INSERT COUNTRY], zip code [INSERT ZIP CODE]? We would like to pay with PayPal. * How long will it take to receive the sample?* What types of packaging do you usually use for this product?* How long does it take to manufacture once an order has been placed?* What is the product-per-unit cost including shipping via Air Express to the United States, ZIP code 85043?* Do you accept PayPal for the full-order?""We would be very grateful if you would contact us with answers to the above questions as well as any additional policies that we may need to know. We would also like to discuss with you further about doing a sample order for the product.We are hopeful that we can start a mutually beneficial relationship. Please add me on Skype and talk to me, as this is my ideal form of communication: [INSERT ID]Alternatively you can email me back at this address: [INSERT ADDRESS]Kind regards,[NAME]”Here are some final tips to keep in mind when you are looking to find a supplier on Alibaba to manufacture your Amazon FBA private label products: Tip #1 on how to find a supplier on Alibaba: Don’t judge the supplier/manufacture by their Alibaba response rate.The Alibaba response rate only takes into account how fast they respond within Alibaba’s email system, and it doesn’t take into account how fast they reply to personal emails. This is not a good indicator of how responsive they will be to private communication, which is all you should care about.Tip #2 on how to find a supplier on Alibaba: Avoid manufacturers that try to vet your business. If a manufacturer comes back and starts asking questions about your business, clearly skeptical of the size of your company, it is best to move on. Manufacturers that do this will usually decline to work with you as they are only to work with other large companies, so you don’t want to waste your time. Tip #3 on how to find a supplier on Alibaba: It is OK to work directly with a sales rep - if they offer you a better deal. When you are looking to find a supplier on Alibaba, you’ll discover that sales reps often have inflated prices (due to commission cuts). But occasionally, a sales rep will have a better relationship with a factory and so are able to negotiate lower prices. They will also often have good english, making communication easier. Vet sales reps and treat them as equals during the process of picking and choosing the right supplier.",manufacturing

    Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Manufacturing
  ","https://www.youtube.com/c/EliasFélixd...Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II ManufacturingPublicado em 12 de fev de 2017The F-35 production process has been called an orchestra where time-tested manufacturing principles, next generation tooling techniques and a highly skilled workforce perform together to produce unmatched capabilities for American and allied forces.More than 300,000 individual parts all come together to produce the F-35 Lightning II at Lockheed Martin's mile+-long factory in Fort Worth, Texas. In addition, final assembly and checkout is performed at facilities in Cameri, Italy and Nagoya, Japan.The F-35 program brings together the world’s most experienced aerospace industry leaders, including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, BAE Systems and Pratt and Whitney. The global team also includes more than 1,400 suppliers from domestic and international companies around the world. This landmark project combines team expertise with sophisticated manufacturing, engineering and technological capabilities.The F-35 production strategy is based on flow-to-takt manufacturing implementation. Flow-to-takt is the movement of component assemblies, like wings and forward fuselages, from one build station to the next at a rate equal to the delivery rate. This production rhythm increases efficiencies, lowers costs and reduces span times while synchronizing the delivery of parts, timing of tasks and positioning of personnel to achieve standard work in each line position.The F-35 production strategy is already paying tremendous dividends. Production learning curves are beating legacy aircraft like the F-16. Costs have come down 57 percent since the procurement of the first production aircraft, and the time it takes to build the F-35 has been reduced by nearly half. As the F-35 prepares to enter full rate production, these key manufacturing indicators are projected to continue to improve.""Subscribe"" & ""Thumb Up""Military-Vid Channel : https://goo.gl/hQH5TxMilitary-Vid Facebook : https://goo.gl/VxXqYzMilitary-Vid twitter : https://twitter.com/sisadocuCategoriaNotícias e políticaLicençaLicença padrão do YouTube",manufacturing

    What is Manufacturing Execution System (MES)?
  ","Let’s tune as our President and CEO Scott Whitlock explains how MES is all about flows within manufacturing – planning flows, execution flows and monitoring flows.Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) are known by many names: data collection solutions, shop floor execution systems, and manufacturing operations management (MOM).Manufacturing Execution Systems collect multiple plants’ production information, and integrate easily with equipment, controllers and enterprise business applications. Although MES solutions are used to operate as a self-contained system, they are increasingly being integrated with enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. The result is complete visibility, control and manufacturing optimization – from order placing, production inception, and process control to product output.------Flexware Innovation, Inc. began in 1996 with a passion for helping manufacturers harness the power of MES and realize the strategic benefits of improved yields, lower operating costs and overall leaner manufacturing. And it’s still a passion for our FlexDogs today, as we help manufacturers across the U.S. implement MES within their operations. It’s one of the things we love most. Well that, and IoT technology within the manufacturing arena, but that’s a blog for another day.------To learn more about Flexware Innovation and how they help manufacturer's with their MES systems, please visit http://www.flexwareinnovation.com/To download our eBook ""5 Risks of Sticking with a Legacy MES"", visit http://flexwareinnovation.com/ebook/",manufacturing

    How To Make A T-Shirt From Design To Manufacturing Process
  ","In this video I show you how to make a t-shirt from the design to manufacturing process. It starts with designing a shirt, pattern making, sewing, cutting and then goes into large production manufacturing. More from Bella Canvas: http://bit.ly/2t9Guo6 When starting a clothing line it's important to know the process, and this video is a great way to learn what it takes to create a t-shirt from scratch. Sign up to the newsletter and receive free downloads to help grow your business + enter to win upcoming giveaways:  http://bit.ly/Apparel-Download The following steps can be applied to make any product, so feel free to jot down notes and reference this section for future use. Step 1: T-Shirt Design The first step to making a t-shirt involves the design sketch. Create a sketch that depicts the angles and details you'd like the final shirt to have. It doesn't have to be super fancy, as long as you can show what you need. Designing a shirt with the end goal in mind helps the pattern maker know what you are going for. Thanks you Torey Lewitz for joining us.Step 2: Pattern MakingOnce the designs are completed, you will consult with a pattern maker to bring your clothing line to life. The pattern maker will take your designs and create “patterns” which are the pieces that will be cut and sewn together. Step 3: Sample CuttingOnce the patterns are completed, they are printing on a plotter that creates the outline for the sample cutter. The person in charge of cutting the sample will follow the guides to ensure the pieces are cut to the right specifications. Castle Notches allow the person in charge of sewing to close the product up right. Step 4: Sewing The T-ShirtAfter the fabric is cut out, it is ready to be sewn. The cut pieces are now the shape of the patterns and multiple sewing machines are used to finish the design. The final outcome is hopefully what you envisioned. But more than likely it won’t be the final fit, so you will repeat the process until you are happy with the size, fit and shape of your apparel line. Step 5: Mass Production CuttingAs soon as the shirt or apparel design you created is approved, the patterns are finalized and sent into the production process. John Chacon Head Of Production walks us through his process. Step 6: Mass Production Sewing Once the pieces are all cut out, they are sent to the sewing factory. The factory is given the cut fabric and the head of production is in charge of making sure everyone knows what their role is. Step 7: Order Fulfillment/ Clothing Line DistributionThe last step in this video is the order fulfillment and distribution of the finished clothing.

    Additive manufacturing: 3-D printing beyond plastic - Science Nation
  ","At Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT), Christopher Williams heads the effort to further advance 3-D printing--known among engineers as additive manufacturing--with copper, a widely used conductor in electronics. Williams is using a process called binder jetting in which an inkjet printer selectively jets glue into a bed of copper powder, layer-by-layer. The printed copper product is then taken to a furnace to fuse the particles togetherWith support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), Williams is addressing a major challenge in the 3-D copper printing process, which is to eliminate the porosity that develops in the part during the process. These microscopic pockets of air weaken the finished product.Williams's goal is to create an additive manufacturing process for copper that would be practical for widespread use. If successful, the results gleaned from this project can also be used to educate future engineers in designing systems with 3-D printing. Beyond the already functioning “3-D printing vending machine” available to students at VT, researchers hope to integrate their findings into an undergraduate/graduate additive manufacturing course, as well as summer workshops for K-12 science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) teachers. These proposed programs will not only instruct students through inquiry-based learning methods but also study how teacher/student perceptions of manufacturing evolve.The research is this episode was supported by NSF award #1254287, Additive Manufacture of Copper Cellular Materials, made through NSF’s CAREER (Faculty Early Career Development) program.NSF Grant URL: http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAw...

    Flexible Manufacturing System(FMS) | Flexible Manufacturing Cell | SMC | ENGINEERING STUDY MATERIALS
  ","Flexible Manufacturing System(FMS) | Flexible Manufacturing Cell | SMC | ENGINEERING STUDY MATERIALS     A flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is a manufacturing system in which there is some amount of flexibility that allows the system to react in case of changes, whether predicted or unpredicted. This flexibility is generally considered to fall into two categories, which both contain numerous subcategories.The first category, routing flexibility, covers the system's ability to be changed to produce new product types, and ability to change the order of operations executed on a part. The second category is called machine flexibility, which consists of the ability to use multiple machines to perform the same operation on a part, as well as the system's ability to absorb large-scale changes, such as in volume, capacity, or capability.Most FMS consist of three main systems. The work machines which are often automated CNC machines are connected by a material handling system to optimize parts flow and the central control computer which controls material movements and machine flow.The main advantages of an FMS is its high flexibility in managing manufacturing resources like time and effort in order to manufacture a new product. The best application of an FMS is found in the production of small sets of products like those from a mass production.AdvantagesReduced manufacturing costLower cost per unit produced,Greater labor productivity,Greater machine efficiency,Improved quality,Increased system reliability,Reduced parts inventories,Adaptability to CAD/CAM operations.Shorter lead timesImproved efficiencyIncrease production rateDisadvantagesInitial set-up cost is high,Substantial pre-planningRequirement of skilled laborComplicated systemMaintenance is complicatedFlexibilityFlexibility in manufacturing means the ability to deal with slightly or greatly mixed parts, to allow variation in parts assembly and variations in process sequence, change the production volume and change the design of certain product being manufactured.Tags: flexible manufacturing system,flexible manufacturing systems (fms),flexible manufacturing cell,flexible manufacturing system layout,flexible manufacturing system nptel,flexible manufacturing system animation,single machine cell,flexible automation and manufacturing cell,fms,flexible manufacturing system lecture,flexible manufacturing system in english,flexible manufacturing system types,flexible manufacturing cell advantages,fmc,smc,machine tool,milling,manufacturingflexible manufacturing system,flexible manufacturing systems (fms),flexible manufacturing cell,flexible manufacturing system layout,flexible manufacturing system nptel,flexible manufacturing system animation,single machine cell,flexible automation and manufacturing cell,fms,flexible manufacturing system lecture,flexible manufacturing system in english,flexible manufacturing system types,flexible manufacturing cell advantages,fmc,smc,machine tool,milling,manufacturing#Engineering_Study_Materials",manufacturing

    Manufacturing: Push or Pull? - Whiteboard Wednesday
  ","Learn more at: http://www.fishbowlinventory.com/quic.... Push or pull? It's a fundamental question for manufacturers. Pushing is a manufacturing method that emphasizes storing a lot of products in order to have them ready to push to customers at a moment's notice. This results in high carrying costs and potentially more unusable inventory as it passes its expiration date.Pulling is more efficient than pushing. It emphasizes JIT (Just In Time) shipping and only ordering parts and products when customer orders come in. This cuts down on carrying costs and leads to a more streamlined operation. It is slower than the push method, so there is a trade-off.Fishbowl's Whiteboard Wednesday videos break down important inventory management topics in a couple of minutes.

    How to Design and Manufacture a Product
  ","It can be quite a challenge to find a manufacturer -- one you like working with and whose factory produces a quality product at a fair price. Here are some tips on how to navigate through the process of finding one, as well as how to optimize your relationship with your manufacturer so that you -- and your customers -- are happy. For more infor visit: http://www.focuspdm.com/Step 1: Creating a PrototypeCreating a working prototype or finding someone who can do it for you is the first step in the manufacturing process. During my early days, I was able to sew most of my prototypes. But as my product, Planecomfort, was refined and the components used and the skills necessary to create the product I envisioned moved beyond my sewing expertise, I knew I needed help. Searching online, I found a wonderful yet small cut-and-sew business in northern California called Left in Stitches.This relationship proved valuable to me in a number of ways. They not only helped refine my original prototype, but they offered many suggestions and ideas for making the product easier to manufacture. Many of these smaller domestic companies offer prototyping services that are invaluable to new entrepreneurs.Once you have a prototype, there is quality and design testing and tweaking. At each stage of development, and every time I received the newer version of my product, I washed, dried, pulled, stretched, zipped, unzipped, and put my product through the proverbial ""ringer."" Making sure your product will exceed your customers' expectations is a sure way to keep them coming back and referring your product to others.Ideally, you want to have a dozen or so finished prototypes. Manufacturers will want one or two samples sent to them as a reference to compare to the finished product their factory is making.I thought I would be able to use Left in Stitches for the long term, but due to logistical reasons and production costs, I had to find an overseas manufacturer. Moving your manufacturing operations overseas means you want large quantities (usually thousands) of the item you are producing. If you want hundreds of something, you may be better off working with a domestic manufacturer.Step 2: Finding a ManufacturerI located my overseas manufacturers through referrals, which provided me with an immediate level of comfort and confidence with these factories. One referral came from a fabric manufacturer. Most fabric manufacturers have relationships with product manufacturers.Another factory was referred to me by a marketing services company. This company manufactures both soft and hard goods and was happy to provide their contact with another business opportunity. Call domestic manufacturers and inquire about their overseas connections. Ask everyone you know if they know someone who manufactures the type of products you are creating. Search online for companies with products similar to yours and call them. Who do they use? How did they get started? My experience is that most people will want to help you.I found it was best to work with at least two different companies when trying to decide who will win your business. Who is easiest to work with? Who meets (or beats) your expectations? Is one more knowledgeable than the other? Having a comparison is essential to ensure you are getting a quality product at a fair price.There are two common ways you can deal with overseas manufacturing. You can find a broker or agent in the U.S. that represents the factory, or deal with a factory directly.Once you have determined who you might like to work with, you must check references on your contact and the factory. Some of the important questions to ask:Was the product made to specifications?What percentage of the shipment was defective?If there was a problem with the shipment, did the factory make restitution?Were deadlines met? If not, what did the factory offer to make amends?Is what was promised delivered?How is the quality of goods they produce?How long have you worked with this person and factory?How many orders have you placed?Is your contact easy to work with?Is he/she responsive to calls and emails?What type of projects does the factory excel in producing? Soft goods, hard goods?What types of companies do they normally work with?Who is responsible for landing the goods in the U.S.?Text by Ann Merlini, founder of Pac'n Nap, LLC.For more information on How to Design and Manufacture a Product visit: http://www.focuspdm.com/",manufacturing

    Improve Operator Efficiency - Manufacturing
  ","Measuring and improving operator efficiency of machines and equipment on the shopfloor can have a dramatic effect on manufacturing productivity and output.PlantRun systems can be used to measure, track and analyse individual operator performance and compare the performance of machine operators against time/machine/product etc.. This allows you to identify under performing staff for re-training and to spread the best practices of your most efficient staff thereby improving operator efficiency.Improved Time ManagementOperators starting late, taking extra time during breaks, finishing early and taking longer to restart a machine than they should is a typical scenario in many manufacturing companies.Even if  this is only arriving at the machine 5 minutes late, starting up 5 minutes later, taking an extra 10 minutes over lunchtime and then finishing 10 minutes early it amounts to 30 minutes in an 8 hour shift equivalent to 6.25%. Without continuous monitoring in place this is often much longer. And this is per machine, if you have 20 machines you are losing 10 man hours per shift!Maybe you don't think your staff do this, but until you measure breaks accurately you don't really know. For one PlantRun user a ""ten minute"" break period was reduced from 23 minutes down to 13 minutes upon installation of the system!Increasing Operator ProductivityAn example of increased operator productivity comes from a wire fabrication company producing a wide range of goods including roll containers, stillages, pallet converters, dollies, picking trollies and garment rails.The company employ a core staff of around 100 staff but at peak production times this number can double with low skilled agency staff. The productivity of temporary staff is variable and with a relatively labour intensive production process maximising operator output is vital. All the fabrication machinery is monitored for machine utilization efficiency.Operators log on to the system at shift start up and the system monitors run time, stop time and reasons for stoppage. By analysing downtime stoppages problems such as extended operator breaks are identified and addressed.System reports make it easy to identify operators with poor productivity performance for training or replacement.  A typical reported improvement in operator productivity boosted output per shift from 80 to 94 units, an increase of 17.5%.Improved MotivationStaff motivation can be improved in two ways.Firstly, the data collected by the system can be used to keep staff informed of their performance against target production rates either using the keypad terminals or large shopfloor displays.  Goal setting and competition between work groups or cells can significantly improve motivation and output.Secondly, the awareness that production is being monitored and the understanding that computers can't lie often have a refreshing effect on staff behavioural patterns and bad practices that may have been formed over time. In some cases dramatic improvements in productivity have been recorded before systems have been fully installed, simply from improving operator efficiency.",manufacturing

Clay which provides aluminium and silica.Cement is manufactured by two methods they are. Wet process. Dry process. Now let us discuss wet process and dry process detailed.WET PROCESS:In the wet process, first the clay is purified by washing in a wash mill.The lime stone is crushed into small particles and mixed with purified clay in proper proportions to get raw slurry.DRY PROCESS: In the dry process the raw materials are mixed in proper proportions.The mixture is dried, pulverized (Crushed into fine particles) and made uniform. The resulting powder is called ""raw material"".The raw slurry or raw meal, obtained by one of wet or dry process called charge. Charge is introduced into a rotary Kiln.The rotary kiln consists of a steel cylinder about 150meters long and 4meter diameter and rotates 30 to 60 turns per hour.At one end of the cylinder a screw conveyer is arranged which slowly allows the charge into the cylinder.The other end of the cylinder, a burneris arranged coal or burning oil is burnt at this end.The charge entering the cylinder slowly moves towards the hot end.At the burning end of the kiln, the temperature is around 1700 to 1900degrees centigrade, at this end some chemical reactions takes place between calcium oxide and aluminium silicates.Mixture of calcium silicates and calcium aluminates is formed.The resultant product consists of gray hard balls called clinker cement.Clinker cement is cooled, ground to fine powder and mixed with 2 to 3 percent of gypsum.",manufacturing

GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE meaning - GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE definition - GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE explanation.Source: Wikipedia.org article, adapted under https://creativecommons.org/licenses/... license.SUBSCRIBE to our Google Earth flights channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Uu...Good manufacturing practices (GMP) are the practices required in order to conform to the guidelines recommended by agencies that control authorization and licensing for manufacture and sale of food, drug products, and active pharmaceutical products. These guidelines provide minimum requirements that a pharmaceutical or a food product manufacturer must meet to assure that the products are of high quality and do not pose any risk to the consumer or public.Good manufacturing practices, along with good agricultural practices, good laboratory practices and good clinical practices, are overseen by regulatory agencies in the United States, Canada, Europe, China, and other countries.Good manufacturing practice guidelines provide guidance for manufacturing, testing, and quality assurance in order to ensure that a food or drug product is safe for human consumption. Many countries have legislated that food and pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers follow GMP procedures and create their own GMP guidelines that correspond with their legislation.All guidelines follow a few basic principles:Manufacturing facilities must maintain a clean and hygienic manufacturing area.Controlled environmental conditions in order to prevent cross contamination of food or drug product from adulterants that may render the product unsafe for human consumption.Manufacturing processes are clearly defined and controlled. All critical processes are validated to ensure consistency and compliance with specifications.Manufacturing processes are controlled, and any changes to the process are evaluated. Changes that affect the quality of the drug are validated as necessary.Instructions and procedures are written in clear and unambiguous language. (Good Documentation Practices)Operators are trained to carry out and document procedures.Cross contamination with unlabelled major allergens is prevented.Records are made, manually or by instruments, during manufacture that demonstrate that all the steps required by the defined procedures and instructions were in fact taken and that the quantity and quality of the food or drug was as expected. Deviations are investigated and documented.Records of manufacture (including distribution) that enable the complete history of a batch to be traced are retained in a comprehensible and accessible form.The distribution of the food or drugs minimizes any risk to their quality.A system is available for recalling any batch from sale or supply.Complaints about marketed products are examined, the causes of quality defects are investigated, and appropriate measures are taken with respect to the defective products and to prevent recurrence.Practices are recommended with the goal of safeguarding the health of consumers and patients as well as producing good quality food, medicine, medical devices, or active pharmaceutical products. In the United States, a food or drug may be deemed ""adulterated"" if it has passed all of the specifications tests, but is found to be manufactured in a facility or condition which violates or does not comply with current good manufacturing guideline. Therefore, complying with GMP is mandatory in all pharmaceutical manufacturing, and most food processing....",manufacturing

    Lean Manufacturing: Cycle Time Analysis, Variance Tracking & Eliminating Work Stoppages
  ","http://www.driveyoursuccess.com The following video is a summary of a project that was run for a small manufacturer were we analyzed their production throughput, performed cycle time analysis and review while also tracking the variances in those cycle times. We use three methods to calculate average in cycle time analysis for this and other projects. These three are the mean, the mode and the median.The video explains how to calculate manufacturing cycle time averages in these three aforementioned ways. The mean is the one we always associate as average. This simply involves taking all the cycle times in a given sample portion and dividing it by the number of operations or cycle times captured.The next method of the mode manufacturing cycle time which is simply the cycle time that appears most frequently during the sample portion. Ultimately, the mode is often the one where the work stoppages and downtime are not a factor. As such, it's often the best benchmark for cycle time analysis.Finally, the median involves re-configuring all the times from lowest to highest and using the following calculation to identify the average time: Median { ( N + 1 ) / 2 } where N is the number of operations. In this case, it's 10 +1 = 11 divided by 2 which is 5.5. Therefore, we isolate the cycle time in-between the 5th and 6th time. Finally, all of these cycle times are placed on a graph in order to identify the variances in cycle times and high and low points. The idea is to isolate the root causes of high and low cycle times while putting a plan in motion to eliminate causes of work stoppages.

    Manufacturing in space could save life on Earth | James Orsulak | TEDxMileHigh
  ","You care about the future of our planet. You traded in your gas-guzzling SUV for a Prius and your Keurig for a Coffee Maker -- and if enough of us do that, we’ll save the Earth, right? Well, we are dangerously close to collapsing our own ecosystem and we are running out of time. In this persuasive talk, James Orsulak argues that the only way to really make a difference is to look up. James Orsulak serves as the Director of Business Development at Planetary Resources, an asteroid mining company that has embarked on the world’s first commercial deep space exploration. The company focuses on technologies such as rocket propellant, water for life support functions, and construction materials sourced from asteroids. Previously, James spent a decade developing industrial-scale fueling stations on Earth. He is an avid gardener who lives in Denver with his amazing wife, 2-year-old twins and a rambunctious Goldendoodle named Waffles. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",manufacturing

    Traditional Enamel Dial Manufacturing
  ","Dials made of enamel can last forever, have a great smooth aspect, are prestigious because of their very artisenal production process and have existed since the 17th century. We find them today in historical pieces visible in museums. This technique was used until the beginning of the 20th century. Then metal dials replaced them because it became possible to add colorful decorations. Since then, enamel has used mostly been used on exclusive watches. Enamel is composed of glass powder extracted from silica. We don’t produce enamel powder ourselves; we buy it from companies mostly based in France, the United Kingdom, and the United-States. They contain metal oxides that give different colors to the substance, essentially added to transparent enamels. The whiteness and opacity of the white enamel dial comes from the breakdown of arsenic. But today, there is no substitute for obtaining the whiteness we have on our dials, for instance. We work following the same traditional method used before.This starts with a disc made out of copper. This precise metal is used because of its maneuverability. It allows us to create dials with different shapes, both domed and flat. First, we weld feet to the back of the disc. Then we heat the dial to about 950°C to relax the metal. The process continues by cleaning it and scrubbing it to reintroduce some tension. Thus, the piece remains solid during the next operations. The first layers of enamel are put on the back and front of the dial at the same time by dusting enamel powder before putting it in the kiln for the first time. The back layer is necessary as every new one added on the front adds tension to the metal. Without it, the dial would bend and finally break.A dial made out of enamel is like gold: timeless.",manufacturing

    Manufacturer Price Sheet: Material, Labor, Overhead & Profit
  ","The following video breaks down how a manufacturer should come up with a price for industrial finished goods. First, the company must account for its material costs and apply a 5 percent indirect cost to that portion of the manufacturer's price sheet.This 5 percent is meant to offset overruns in production and or additional costs of financing inventory and material purchases.Second, the company must account for its labor relative to each operation performed to turn a raw material into a finished good. The calculation involves defining the operation and applying the labor cost to both the setup time in manufacturing and the actual run time. Third, all labor costs are added in order to come up with a complete total for all the costs of manufacturing a given product. Those costs are then followed up by the company's overhead, which is calculated by taking its indirect expenses divided by its direct expenses. Indirect expenses are those expenses that are in addition to the the costs needed to produce a part. Direct expenses are exactly that. These include the costs involved or expenses involved in manufacturing the part. Finally, the company adds its mark-up in order to secure a profit on the sale. Profit is critical because it helps to fund the company's pursuit of new product introductions and secure its long-term future. Here is a sample of the Manufacturer Price Sheet in Excel Formathttp://www.driveyoursuccess.com Video explains how to price a product with direct material, labor, overhead and profit",manufacturing

    The New Manufacturing: Ted Hall at TEDxRichmond
  ","Ted Hall, founder and CEO of ShopBot Tools, Inc., first got excited about digital fabrication 20 years ago. Ted wanted a digitally controlled tool that would cut plywood parts for backyard boatbuilding projects. In trying to find such a tool, he learned that the CNC (computer numerically controlled) technology of the time was heavily industrial and oriented to high-volume manufacturing. Ted's idea, which would become ShopBot, was to create a digital fabrication tool that was instead oriented to use by individuals and small shops. A tool that took advantage of the technology's capability to cut, drill, sculpt, machine, carve, or trim with high precision and in relation to a digital model -- but that made sense in a small shop for making one object or many, and that empowered individuals through the new technology with enhanced capabilities to express their creativity in projects of all sizes and using a wide range of materials.In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",manufacturing

    Germany Worm Gears Manufacture - Discover Heavyweight Production |  Technology Connections
  ","Watch this video if you are interested in Germany Worm Gears Manufacture. The video is about Germany Worm Gears Manufacture - Discover Heavyweight Production |  Technology Connections. If there is any copyright strike, please contact me via dotuanvu237@gmail.comI will fully follow the copyright owner decision!A worm drive is a gear arrangement in which a worm (which is a gear in the form of a screw) meshes with a worm gear (which is similar in appearance to a spur gear). The two elements are also called the worm screw and worm wheel. The terminology is often confused by imprecise use of the term worm gear to refer to the worm, the worm gear, or the worm drive as a unit.Like other gear arrangements, a worm drive can reduce rotational speed or transmit higher torque. A worm is an example of a screw, one of the six simple machines.One of the major advantages of worm gear drive units are that they can transfer motion in 90 degrees.A gearbox designed using a worm and worm-wheel is considerably smaller than one made from plain spur gears, and has its drive axes at 90° to each other. With a single start worm, for each 360° turn of the worm, the worm-wheel advances only one tooth of the gear wheel. Therefore, regardless of the worm's size (sensible engineering limits notwithstanding), the gear ratio is the ""size of the worm wheel - to - 1"". Given a single start worm, a 20 tooth worm wheel reduces the speed by the ratio of 20:1. With spur gears, a gear of 12 teeth must match with a 240 tooth gear to achieve the same 20:1 ratio. Therefore, if the diametrical pitch (DP) of each gear is the same, then, in terms of the physical size of the 240 tooth gear to that of the 20 tooth gear, the worm arrangement is considerably smaller in volume.There are three different types of gears that can be used in a worm drive.The first are non-throated worm gears. These don't have a throat, or groove, machined around the circumference of either the worm or worm wheel. The second are single-throated worm gears, in which the worm wheel is throated. The final type are double-throated worm gears, which have both gears throated. This type of gearing can support the highest loading.[1]An enveloping (hourglass) worm has one or more teeth and increases in diameter from its middle portion toward both ends.[2]Double-enveloping wormgearing comprises enveloping worms mated with fully enveloping wormgears. It is also known as globoidal wormgearing. technology information technology news technology in education technology future technology innovation technology solutions bearing machinery cnc",manufacturing

    Are Cobots Useful in Manufacturing?

So, are cobots really useful in the world of manufacturing?The short answer is yes! While high-production facilities benefit from fast, elaborate work cells that are fully automated, smaller facilities that operate with high-mix, low-volume production either can't afford or can't fully utilize those faster, industrial systems.Cobots provide the ability to change, pivot, and adapt with an automation system.

    Noam Chomsky's Manufacturing Consent revisited | The Listening Post
  ","There is an exquisite and oft-quoted moment in an interview between BBC journalist Andrew Marr and Noam Chomsky in which Marr asks: ""How can you know that I'm self-censoring?"".""I'm not saying you're self censoring. I'm sure you believe everything you're saying. But what I'm saying is that if you believed something different, you wouldn't be sitting where you're sitting.""Wry as ever, Chomsky exposed the slightly delusional pretensions of the journalistic establishment - and not far behind, the complicities of the media industry with political power.Harsh? Perhaps. True? All too often.For many of us who work at The Listening Post, Chomsky's ideas on the media in Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media have provided us with a guide, full of cautionary tales and ideas that are still controversial to this day.The book was published in 1988 - a year before the end of the Cold War when it was announced that western liberal democracy had triumphed, heralding the end of ideology, authoritarianism, and propaganda.In the past 30 years, we have seen the mass communications industry multiply, providing an illusion of choice, echoing the rhetorics of freedom - of press, of expression - but not necessarily yielding the pluralism liberal democracies had promised.In that way, the book continues to resonate.But like all revered texts, Manufacturing Consent also calls upon us as active readers, journalists, citizens to interrogate its premises. Does the book's denunciatory tone risk overstate the power of the media establishment? Does it underestimate the critical faculties of the public? Is the media so homogenous an entity that power can be wielded top-down? Where are the lapses, the blind spots? Where do journalists find pockets of power that serve to disrupt?We spoke to three journalists who have their careers being disruptive and asked them about the ideas that had influenced them in Chomsky and Herman's book: Matt Taibbi, whose reporting for Rolling Stone has provided one of the most critical accounts of US political history in recent years; Indian editor-in-chief Aman Sethi who questions the premises of Chomsky's book and Amira Hass, the Haaretz correspondent for the Occupied Territories.The first thing we asked Hass was what she thought about Chomsky's statement: ""the general population doesn't know what's happening, and it doesn't even know that it doesn't know"".""This is a very humanist and optimistic statement,"" she responded. ""The belief that when people are informed they may act, things may change. In Hebrew, the words knowledge and awareness are all made of the same root. Yedda and Mudaoot. And so awareness is connected to Mudaoot in Hebrew. And this is how I started working in Gaza, aware that the Israeli public knows nothing about the occupation and what it means. But the people do not pick up this information. They have access to it but they choose not to access it.""Hass has been covering Palestine for the best part of 30 years - in that time, sources of information have multiplied, but public outrage?""Today we have so much access to information in other ways that we are on a collision with the fact that people are not interested in what does not serve immediately their interest,"" she said, with resignation, ""and this is a very sad realisation.""Aman Sethi put it like this:""It's easy to say that people believe what they believe because their consent has been manufactured. But what if people know exactly what's going on and still believe what they believe, right? Then that's terrifying.""More from The Listening Post on:YouTube - http://aje.io/listeningpostYTFacebook - http://facebook.com/AJListeningPostTwitter - http://twitter.com/AJListeningPostWebsite - http://aljazeera.com/listeningpost- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/",manufacturing

    The Manufacturing of Synthetic Quartz Crystals
  ","Here we have yet another video from the old AT&T archives. This one goes into a little more scientific detail on the process for growing synthetic (cultured) quartz crystals. I have been researching the synthesis of quartz and other minerals for nearly ten years. This particular video has only recently been uncovered in my studies. It is interesting to note that the crystals you see being produced in this video, cost well over $1000ea (in 1960's dollars) when they were first made available. Ironically, the process of quartz (and other crystal) synthesis remains more of an art than a science. Although the basic principles are well understood, much experimentation has been done behind the closed doors of various private companies. Formulas for liquid mineralizing agents, seed plate orientation, autoclave design, growth temperatures and pressures, and feed-stock composition and morphology remain closely guarded secrets. The good news, is that many different test runs have given collectors such as myself many interesting specimens to collect. The problem however, is locating the crystals owners (many of whom are retired workers in the crystal industry themselves), and brokering a sale. Occasionally, i meet someone like my friend Dimitry Belakovsky, who actually worked for the secretive Soviet Institute of Material Sciences, and I uncover huge stores of rare experimental crystals. Other times, I have been contacted by workers who acquired their crystals when the parent company went out of business. Sadly, this is more common than you might think. Today, the only US manufacturer of Quartz crystals that I am aware of is Sawyer Labs in East Lake, Ohio. They were kind enough to reward my inquiries with a huge carton of ""out of production"" crystals at no charge. If you don't ask, you never know.Today, virtually all synthetic quartz crystals are being produced in Japan, China and the Russian Federation. And because new technology has greatly reduced the need for quartz in electronics, you see little investment in new facilities outside of these countries.  Today's modern autoclaves have evolved into titanic monsters that can generate 4500kg of crystals in a single run. Some of these crystals are up to 20kg or more in size. Anyway, enjoy this video, and check out some of my other crystal videos. Note the ""Forbidden Planet"" soundtrack used in this video's soundtrack. Kind of cool.",manufacturing

    2020 Chevrolet Silverado Production  Heavy-Duty Trucks
  ","2020 Chevrolet Silverado Production at General Motors Flint Assembly (Michigan, USA)00:01 Silverado HD Manufacturing03:29 Four Post Durability Testing Flint — Chevrolet introduced its redesigned 2020 Heavy Duty pickups Tuesday at its truck assembly plant here, the third all-new Silverado in 18 months.The new truck, built at the renovated Flint Assembly Plant, will require 1,000 new jobs at the plant, General Motors Co. President Mark Reuss said.The new truck and jobs at Flint Assembly come as GM is laying off some 4,000 salaried workers in the next few weeks. Reuss acknowledged the somber circumstances before kicking off the presentation of the new Silverado Heavy Duty.""As difficult as it’s been, these are the right decisions to make the company more competitive today and more successful in the future and long-term,"" Reuss said.Chevy gave a sneak peek of the truck in December, debuting a new exterior design that differs from the light-duty Silverado that debuted at the Detroit auto show last year.Powered by an all-new gas-powered V-8 engine paired with the 10-speed Allison transmission that debuted on the new heavy-duty GMC Sierra last month, the new Heavy Duty breaks away from the Camaro-inspired grille design on the 1500 with a bolder fascia and bigger headlights. Chevy said in December that the Heavy Duty trucks only share a roof with the light-duty 1500.Every diesel-powered Chevy dually will now tow more than 30,000 pounds. And the gas-powered 2500 HD's max towing is 17,400 pounds, an 18 percent increase from the current model.The 6.6-liter V-8 Duramax turbo-diesel engine will develop 445 horsepower and 910 pounds-feet of torque, falling short of the 1,000-pounds-feet of torque achieved by rival Ram's new heavy-duty truck.Lead engineer Jaclyn McQuaid acknowledged the higher torque from competitors, but said that Chevrolet has strengthened the heavy-duty trucks' axles, locking rear-differential, prop shaft and u-joint to allow the truck to use all 910 pound-feet of torque in first gear.Chevy's new behemoths will still benefit from the light-duty Silverado's new high-strength steel architecture with a new chassis that allows for three more inches of rear legroom.And the HD's box, which already has corner steps for easier access, gets two more steps at the front of the box for easier, forward-box access.Subscribe: http://www.youtube.com/c/CarsBOOM",manufacturing

We have several different BUs. So we handle the whole spectrum of a person's life stages.Digital tools are simply critical for us to be able of thedelivering this manufacturing of the future. Two and a half years ago we watched the technician re-enter data from one system to the next system for the next system.  It was so disempowering. They were very frustrated that the systems weren't integrated.  We needed a solution that could really scale with us.The way we operate the business the way people learn is different. And, we have to be ready for that.Our vision is that each operation team has a tool in their handto improve their business results.Out on the lines on to tablets so they can interact with the data real time at the point that they need to not over back over the desk. Because the work doesn't happen at the desk. Work happens at the piece of equipment.From our team rooms we went away from you know hard writtenpaper or single desk typing to touchscreen technology so they can get there and drag new data around. It blew me away.One of the primary benefit is the flexibility you get in a platform solution. In terms of time savings, energy savings, we're going to at least see 45-minute pressure per line per business unit.It has the flexibility to look at the same data in different ways that make sense for that particular operational team at that particular time.The KPIs from that digital platform really help us visualize the operational level. Including process reliability which is really efficiency of the operations, safety and quality.Too often we provide a solution that is limited.I'm very confident in GE's ability to expand this outside the factory walls to look at the entire supply chain.  The people that we have worked with at GE when they say they're going to do something they really deliver excellence and they deliver it on time.",manufacturing

    Automating Visual Inspections in Energy and Manufacturing with AI (Cloud Next '19)
  ","AES is a Fortune 500 global power company, generating and distributing sustainable energy in 15 countries, owning and managing $33 billion in assets. To optimally serve their mission of accelerating a safer, greener, energy future, AES has rigorously scaled the use of drone technologies and machine learning in their wind farm operations. Using Google’s AutoML Vision, they can help automate the detection of defects, and prioritize maintenance of their high-value assets.LG CNS is a global IT services company with USD$2.7 billion in annual sales. They supply IT solutions for the LG Group's affiliates and other companies, and apply big data and AI to improve manufacturing processes at scale. Originally, many inspectors were required to detect defects in everything from LCD and OLED panels, to optical films and automotive fabrics. But the monotony of visual inspections led to many errors, so LG CNS built their own in-house AI solution to visually inspect products on the assembly line. This required lots of time and effort to achieve high performing machine learning models, and they experienced a shortage of highly skilled AI experts. They turned to Google's AutoML Vision Edge to design and distribute models to the edge, and centrally control the performance of their deployed models in one integrated system. This improved accuracy and performance, and reduced the time it takes to build high quality models.

    Manufacturing Predictions - The future of the manufacturing industry (ISCF - Clean Growth)
  ","What will the future of manufacturing be like?Imagine needing a new part for a household appliance. You could order it, get it made locally and get it delivered to your door within a couple of hours.Advances in 3D Printing and additive manufacturing will reduce waste even more, making it possible to create products and components that we can't make now.Everything will be connected by the Internet of Things to ensure that supply can keep track of changes in demand.Robots will take care of the repetitive, dangerous processes so that people can focus on matters where human interaction is so valuable. So whether you are a manufacturer or a consumer, we are going to see much more manufacturing as part of our everyday lives.Anything, anywhereIn the next 30 years, we will see manufacturing become more and more unbound from the idea of factories as we know them today. It will be freed up to appear in new locations, becoming an empowering force that drives customisation and personalisation of products across multiple sectors. All of this thanks to 3D printing innovation.Fast forward to 2035: Do you see a piece of jewellery you like in a shop window, but it’s not quite the right colour or size? The shop will be able to 3D print you a custom piece in minutes, based precisely on your measurements and preferences. 3D Printing will drive a true paradigm shift for manufacturing, away from the mass production in a distant factory to something that happens right in front of you, creating a bespoke product for the same cost. By 2050 you may even be able to print clothes at home from designs shared online.Subscribe to our YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/Innovate...Find out about our other predictions, including healthcare and cities, here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Click here to find out our essential tips for small businesses: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...",manufacturing

    MANUFACTURE OF THE BOFORS 40mm ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN AT CHRYSLER  BOFORS GUN TEAM 58844
  ","Support Our Channel : https://www.patreon.com/PeriscopeFilmMade as part of the WWII war effort by Chrysler, THE BOFORS GUN TEAM shows the manufacture of the Bofors 40mm anti-aircraft gun then in use by the Navy and Army. This was one of the most stunning manufacturing feats of the war, since the Bofors was an extremely intimidating weapon to mass produce and many believed it could not be produced in quantity, in time to make a difference in the war. Within 3 years however Chrysler had shipped over 40,000 complete mechanisms and 75,000 barrels. At 1:55, the Swedish-designed gun is seen in its ""Americanized"" configuration -- made for mass production in a Chrysler factory. At 2:30, new blueprints are made from Swedish originals which were in metric measure. At 2:45, a diagram shows how the manufacture of the gun was split between Dodge, DeSoto, Plymouth and other Chrysler plants. Production lines are seen for breech casings and other parts in the gigantic plants, which were formerly used for automobile manufacture. At 8:55, blocks are shown being made through mass production techniques. At 9:11, quality inspection is made of the blocks. At 13:30, the manufacture of the gun barrel is seen. At 16:20, breech blocks are assembled and tested. The Bofors 40 mm gun, often referred to simply as the Bofors gun,is an anti-aircraft/multi-purpose autocannon designed in the 1930s by the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors. It was one of the most popular medium-weight anti-aircraft systems during World War II, used by most of the western Allies as well as by the Axis powers. A small number of these weapons remain in service to this day, and saw action as late as the Gulf War.In the post-war era the original design was not suitable for action against jet powered aircraft, so Bofors introduced a new model of significantly more power, the 40 mm L/70. In spite of sharing almost nothing with the original design other than the calibre and the distinctive conical flash hider, this weapon is also widely known simply as ""the Bofors"". Although not as popular as the original L/60 model, the L/70 remains in service, especially as a multi-purpose weapon for light armored vehicles, as on the CV 90.  In order to supply both the Army and Navy with much greater numbers of the guns, Chrysler built 60,000 of the guns and 120,000 barrels through the war, at half the original projected cost, and filling the Army's needs by 1943. Over the lifetime of the production, their engineers introduced numerous additional changes to improve mass production, eventually reducing the overall time needed to build a gun by half; most of these changes were in production methods rather than the design of the gun itself.York Safe & Lock also produced the weapons, though its attempts to coordinate drawings across the program were unsuccessful, and this responsibility was transferred to the Naval Gun Factory in July 1943.There were many difficulties in producing the guns within the United States, beyond their complexity (illustrated by the use of 2,000 subcontractors in 330 cities and 12 Chrysler factories to make and assemble the parts).

    Grand opening of Herbalife Innovation & Manufacturing Facility in Winston-Salem
  ","Herbalife officially unveiled the grand opening of its Innovation & Manufacturing Facility in Winston-Salem today. Members of the local business, civic community, along with Herbalife executives, were on hand to take local officials and the media on a tour of the facility. Herbalife promised more than 500 jobs to the local community. So far, more than 350 jobs have been filled, with more to come by the end of the year.  Herbalife Innovation & Manufacturing (H.I.M.) in Winston- Salem further expands Herbalife global manufacturing capacity and is in line with the company's strategy toincrease self-manufacturing for its top products.  H.I.M. Winston-Salem is an example of significant investment by Herbalife in cutting-edge technology and innovation.

The facility produces a variety of nutritional products, including powders, such as the flagship Formula 1 Nutritional Shake Mix; liquids, such as the Herbal Aloe Concentrate; and teas, such as Herbal Tea Concentrate. Products manufactured at HIM Winston-Salem will be distributed in the United States and exported to more than 50 countries around the world.  Since announcing the Triad location in December 2012, Herbalife has invested more than $100 million to convert the over 800,000 square foot site to meet its exacting specifications.  The retro-fit of the building ensures it is in full compliance with U.S. Good Manufacturing Practices for dietary supplements, acidified foods and food products. Within months of its operational start-up, the facility received NSF accreditation—a certification key to ensuring that products manufactured in Winston Salem meet strict standards for public health protection -- and its quality control laboratory received the highly regarded ISO 17025 certification. The flagship facility for Herbalife, and one of the most advanced facilities in the nutrition industry as a whole, also houses Herbalife’s technical operations Center of Excellence, an R&D laboratory complex that ensures products are backed by the best nutrition science. HIM Winston-Salem is Herbalife’s second U.S. manufacturing facility and the largest of four company-owned facilities worldwide (one in Lake Forest, California and two in China).  Herbalife will also locate its Global Technical Operations Center, as well as state-of-the-art quality and testing laboratories at the Winston-Salem location. Facts: Currently approximately 350 employees; will employ more than 500 when facility reaches full production by the end of 2015. The 800,000 square-foot facility is one-mile around.

    Audi Smart Factory - Future of Audi Production
  ","Audi Smart Factory P-Tech Day. Subscribe.Audi is making its production fit for the future with the smart factory. In this factory of the future, big data – the creation and intelligent connection of large volumes of data – will facilitate data‑driven and thus highly flexible and highly efficient manufacturing. A method of production in which Audi might no longer build its cars on an assembly line but according to a radically new, disruptive concept is modular assembly. In addition to this major project, Audi is pursuing many other exciting projects for the production of the future – from the application of virtual‑reality glasses to metal 3D printing.Modular assembly.The complexity of automobile production is increasing. New market needs, customer expectations and the legislative framework are increasingly requiring innovative technologies and differing vehicle versions. This means that the fixed timing of the assembly line is becoming less efficient. The more the number of derivatives and variants grows, the more difficult it becomes to master high complexity and integrate new routines into the rigid, sequential process.Audi intends to meet this challenge and to develop a completely new principle for it: modular assembly. With this method, small, separate workstations allow highly flexible working routines – in terms of both time and space. Between those workstations, driverless transport systems take over the transport of the car bodies as well as the parts required for production. A central computer precisely controls the driverless transport systems – it recognizes the needs of each individual station, thus ensuring a smooth workflow.Audi assumes that modular assembly will result in 20 percent better productivity than the assembly lines of today. It is now being applied for test purposes at the engine plant in Győr, Hungary, and application is planned in two further projects.At present, the key principles of this innovative production system are being worked out and tested by “arculus” – a startup company established a few months ago.The Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems.The new driverless transport systems required for modular assembly are being created in Audi’s “Technology Development Production Assistance Systems” department. This small department has developed two types of driverless vehicle: One of them moves under control by a computer, the other moves autonomously on a defined route. Three onboard laser scanners allow the driverless transport systems to orient themselves and to recognize and avoid potentially critical situations. Audi developed the navigation software itself. It is based on automotive software and automotive‑software development processes.The main task of the Technical Center for Production Assistance Systems is to work on new production technologies in early stages of their development. In addition to driverless transport systems, it is also working on four other projects. They comprise safe cooperation between humans and machines when working in the same space, assembly tables with assistance functions and two innovative robots: a flexible gripper arm and a special lightweight robot.The Audi Production Lab.The Audi Production Lab, abbreviated as P‑Lab, develops and supports innovative projects for the production process – often starting with the very first idea. The department currently has five permanent employees andhas already helped to bring innovations such as metal 3D printing, human‑robot cooperation, driverless transport systems and the use of augmented reality at Audi towards series application.The projects currently running in the P‑Lab include two big‑data projects. One of them focuses on the early recognition of mistakes in the placement of screws and bolts; the other examines the flow of components in the area of international logistics for the CKD plants (completely knocked down). Another major subject for the Audi Production Lab is data glasses. They can provide effective support for employees in production, for the planners and engineers in the factory of the future – with assisted reality, augmented reality and virtual reality.Toolmaking.Several future-oriented projects are running in Audi’s Toolmaking division. The structure of the new generation of press tools follows nature, with many parts made of aluminum and plastics. This reduces the weight of those tools, which until now has been up to 45 tons, by up to 20 percent and the energy required decreases by about ten percent. The result is enhanced precision in the forming of sheet‑metal parts.The press shop, where the tools are applied, uses the latest measuring technology. The goal is to develop a complete data chain for each sheet‑metal part. The data chain already begins with the suppliers of steel and aluminum. This is another way in which Audi is enhancing its precision.",manufacturing

Composites are increasing replacing steel or aluminium parts in the aviation industry; moreover, composites are often stronger, more sustainable, less expensive, and capable of being applied in a wide variety of areas.The ACM Pilot Plant allows further robotification of the production of composite landing gear components. In a wider context, the plant will focus on producing composites reinforced with industrial resins, for which the plant is outfitted with ultra-modern equipment, including one of the largest robotic composite fibre braiding machines in Europe.The ACM Pilot Plant is open to companies that want to produce their composites on a large scale, including to companies that are active outside the aviation sector. The unique knowledge and facilities available in Marknesse are ideally suited for developing the most (cost-) efficient manufacturing methods. It is often precisely this last step – between a prototype and launching the product – that proves so difficult in bringing innovations to market.This new facility derives from a Public-Private Partnership between Fokker Landing Gear and the National Aerospace Laboratory (NLR), in close collaboration with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the province of Flevoland and the Noordoostpolder municipality. This Pilot Plant is the embodiment of the ‘golden triangle’ between government, industry and knowledge institutions.

    Archinaut One to Manufacture and Assemble Spacecraft Parts While Orbiting Earth
  ","Made In Space, Inc. of Mountain View, California, will demonstrate the ability of a small spacecraft, called Archinaut One, to manufacture and assemble spacecraft components in low-Earth orbit. Archinaut One is expected to launch on a Rocket Lab Electron rocket from New Zealand no earlier than 2022. Once it’s positioned in low-Earth orbit, the spacecraft will 3D-print two beams that extend 32 feet (10 meters) out from each side of the spacecraft. As manufacturing progresses, each beam will unfurl two solar arrays that generate up to five times more power than traditional solar panels on spacecraft of similar size. The in-space technology demonstration marks the start of the second phase of a partnership established through NASA’s Tipping Point solicitation. The public-private partnership combines NASA resources with an industry contribution of at least 25% of the program costs, shepherding the development of critical space technologies while also saving the agency, and American taxpayers, money.

    Inside the Indian Generic Drug Manufacturer Cipla
  ","India produces over 30% of the world's entire supply of generic drugs. Cipla is one of India's largest drug manufacturers. It supplies antiretroviral drugs to about one third of AIDS patients under treatment in Africa. C&EN Senior Correspondent Jean-François Tremblay went inside Cipla's advanced pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing plant to learn more about the stringent regulations it must follow. India's future as the world's drugstore is a controversial topic. Other drugmakers have been heavily fined, or had products recalled or banned, because of problems at plants. And India is under pressure to make its patent system more like those in western nations. But India has found a market for low-cost drugs and that market isn't about to disappear.More at http://cenm.ag/cplaLike C&EN? Want more chemistry video goodness?

    IACMI Wind Blade Prototype (Composites Manufacturing Innovation)
  ","Knoxville, TN, January 31, 2017— The Institute for Advanced Composites Manufacturing Innovation (IACMI) unveiled an advanced technology prototype wind blade during the Winter IACMI members meeting February 1-2 in Denver, Colorado. The nine- meter long blade was fabricated at IACMI’s Wind Technology Area in the Denver, Colorado area. Commercialization of the wind blade prototype created could speed production times, reduce manufacture cost, and provide stronger, more energy-efficient blades for the United States.A large team of eleven industrial partners, including Arkema Inc., Johns Manville, TPI Composites Inc., Huntsman Polyurethanes, Strongwell, DowAksa USA, Chomarat North America, Composites One, SikaAxson, Creative Foam and Chem-Trend, provided materials and on site fabrication support for blade component manufacturing and assembly. Pultruded spar caps were fabricated at Strongwell in Bristol, Virginia and shipped to Colorado for incorporation into the blade shells. The project was led by IACMI’s Wind Technology Area, based in the Denver, Colorado area , with support from IACMI Headquarters, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office, and the Advanced Industries Program administered by the Colorado Office of Economic Trade and Development (OEDIT).The prototype blade is based on an existing design from previous work conducted by the DOE, representing a small-scale version of a utility-scale multi-megawatt blade. The new blade, molded on tooling supplied by TPI Composites, Inc., features innovations such as impact resistant components, continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic parts and exterior shell components produced with less than half the normal CO2 emissions commonly emitted in wind blade manufacture.",manufacturing

    What Foxconn - Apple's Largest Manufacturer - Is Up To In Wisconsin
  ","Foxconn is the world's largest contract manufacturer of electronics and the biggest assembler of Apple products. Now it's building a massive factory in a village in rural Wisconsin. In a deal heralded by politicians including President Donald Trump and then Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, Wisconsin offered Foxconn close to $4 billion in subsidies to bring the project there. In return, Foxconn promised 13,000 jobs and a $10 billion investment in Wisconsin. In the last two years, however, plans have changed many times and locals have been forced to move to make way for the 3,000 acre project. CNBC got a rare chance to sit down with Foxconn and the Wisconsin official who helped broker the deal to ask: what's really going on with the project? Watch the video to learn more about the international giant trying to build one of the world's largest factories - in the United States.Clarification: Jim Mahoney decided not to take “a buyout offer” from the town of Mount Pleasant, not directly from Foxconn.» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

  ","For more info about Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing (formerly known as Electron Beam Direct Manufacturing), visit http://www.sciaky.com/additive-manufa....Transcript:Save time and money on the production of large-scale, high-value metal (titanium, tantalum, inconel, stainless steel, etc.) parts and prototypes with Sciaky's Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing (EBAM™) solution.Transcript:Imagine: From this, to this, in a fraction of the time and cost it used to take. With Sciaky’s exclusive Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing, or EBAM™ for short, metal 3D printing is not limited by part size, material, or geometry. You can manufacture parts and structures that exceed 19 feet in length, 4 feet wide, 4 feet high, and 8 feet in diameter, made from virtually any metal, including inconel and stainless steels, and refractory alloys like titanium and tantalum.  How does the EBAM™ process work? Starting with a 3D model from a CAD program, Sciaky’s fully-articulated, moving electron beam gun deposits metal, from wire feedstock, layer by layer, until the part reaches near-net shape and is ready for finish machining. Deposition rates can range from 7 to 20 pounds of metal per hour, which is significantly more efficient and cost-effective than selective laser sintering processes that utilize messy powders. In addition, a dual wire-feed system can be utilized with the EBAM™ process to increase deposition efficiency, as well as to easily switch to different deposition materials. So, whether you need to produce a functional prototype, or a run of production parts, the possibilities are virtually endless. Our technology partners include the Department of Defense, U.S. Air Force, Boeing, DARPA, Penn State University's Applied Research Laboratory and Lockheed Martin.Call the metal 3D printing experts at Sciaky today and find out how EBAM™ – Electron Beam Additive Manufacturing – can save you significant time and money on the production of your critical metal parts.Call Sciaky today, or visit us online at http://www.sciaky.com/additive-manufa...You can also follow us on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/sciakyinc) and Twitter  (https://twitter.com/Sciaky_inc) and Google+ (https://plus.google.com/1149476188268...) to stay up-to-date on our groundbreaking metal additive manufacturing process.",manufacturing

    The Steel Supply Company, Inc. - Threaded Anchor Bolts Manufacturing Process
  ","ASTM F1554 Anchor Bolt Manufacturing Step-By-Step Process at the Steel Supply Company.https://www.thesteelsupplyco.com/anch...The Steel Supply Company stocks round bar from only the best U.S. manufacturers like Nucor, CMC and Steel Dynamics. Steel round bar is stocked in F1554 grades A36, grade 55, and A-105. While not included in the ASTM F1554, round bar grade A449 is sometimes called out on DOT or transportation projects. The Steel Supply Company carries an ample amount of A449 bar, as well.Manufacturing starts by cutting the round bar to length. Chamfering then adds the beveled edge to the round bar, which allows for an easy nut fit on the final bolt. Threading is the most critical step of the manufacturing process. ASTM F1554 clearly states that construction grade anchor bolts be made with a 2A tolerance. This assures the bolt's strength while allowing for proper nut fit. Steel Supply then uses a powerful rotary draw bender that applies even pressure to the round bar while bending it around a mandrel. This creates a hook with no indentations that could compromise the bolt's strength. Or the embedded end is threaded to accept an embed nut; often a plate washer is included and welding is required.Hot dip galvanizing increases the diameter of the bolt. Careful coordination between the thread pitch and zinc coating is required to assure the finished bolt threads correctly.The finished bolts are then packaged for shipment with the hardware. Steel Supply offers a full range of nuts and washers both plain finished and hot dip galvanized. Regardless of the size of the bolts, packaging is done uniformly and carefully to assure your order is delivered accurately and on time.",manufacturing

    Most AMAZING Recent Technology!
  ","Check out the most amazing recent technology! This top 10 list of recent futuristic inventions and cool gadgets from the future is absolutely amazing!  Subscribe For New Videos! http://goo.gl/UIzLeBWatch our ""Most INCREDIBLE Coin Discoveries Around The World!"" video here: https://youtu.be/_BcTxPHP6GwWatch our ""Most AMAZING Places Around The World!"" video here: https://youtu.be/a3l6iREKgAkWatch our ""Most Amazing Cities Found UNDERWATER!"" video here: https://youtu.be/rUqxhYJqGhU#12 3D Printing Organs3D printing has been around for a few years now, but it just recently made breakthroughs bigger than cars or phone cases or toys that have been created before. The 3D printer has started created organs for human use. Sure, prosthetics are understandable. But organs? Research is currently being conducted on artificial heart, kidney, and liver structures, as well as other major organs. Organs like the heart will be tougher but it is definitely possible. Can you imagine being the person that kept organs in stock? Checking your list...okay I need to print three kidneys and four livers today. The reason the 3D printing works so well is that organs are very complicated and the machine does a layer by layer scan of an actual organ. This allows them to give a very detailed printout.Crazy yes. But not as crazy as the ability to print out human skin! Now that craziness is happening as we speak! This can be to repair damaged skin or purely cosmetic reasons. #11 Needleless Vaccines What is your least favorite part of getting flu shots? Oh yeah, the shot. The needle that pierces your skin and stings.This new invention called the ImmunoMatrix patch will allow you to vaccinate yourself with a simple band-aid like patch. This isn’t just great because it’s painless but has even greater benefits. One: It takes a tenth of the vaccine that the syringe does, which saves tons of money. And two: it doesn’t require the glass vial, syringes, hypodermic needles, trained medical personnel, and biohazardous waste disposal. So again, it saves tons and tons of money.Can you imagine it being flu season and you just going to town to pick up your flu patch and adhering it at home? Dream big…and realistically! This is happening.#10 Endless StorageYou know how a terabyte is really big? Well what about a million terabytes? Maybe a trillion? Okay, now imagine an endless amount of storage! Scientists at the University of Southampton have created and are working on advances with this technology. Not only will this device store endless info, but it is pretty much invincible to damage.It is made out of nanostructured glass and has the ability to record and retrieve five dimensional digital data by femtosecond laser writing.As for right now, it can only hold about 360 TB, but things are quickly escalating there. It can go through almost 2000 degrees Fahrenheit and will last longer than anyone on this planet…except maybe the tardigrade. The technology isn’t for public  use yet because it is reserved for preserving historical documents first, since it can hold an entire library of books! They have already stored actual copies of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Newton’s Opticks, Magna Carta and Kings James Bible. #9 Wall Climbing FishEver seen a spider climb a wall? What about a monkey? Hmm…well, what about a wall climbing fish?In the Amazon rain forest, just recently, a wall climbing fish has been discovered. This may not seem like a scientific advancement, but in reality, it means everything! This isn’t the only thing odd about these fish, who were oddly enough born in caves only they could see and we’re colorless! This Ecuadorian fish defies gravity as it hikes up a nearly vertical wall for ten feet!It’s called a Chaetostoma microps, and is a suckermouth armoured catfish. You’ve seen suckerfish climb underwater, but out of water is a whole new thing! Scientists are ecstatic to study the technique and maybe use it to create wall climbing gear for engineers. Another thing that makes this discovery an advancement is that it has never been seen in this exact way before. Meaning, it has either learned the ability on its own, as a species, or…there are still many more species still undiscovered by scientists. #8 Cybernetic ImplantsThe term cyberware is a pretty new field for scientists. Sure, the first pacer was implanted in the 1950s, but that was such a small advancement compared to today. We already have an “artificial pancreas” for diabetics. As of now, it is simply a pod implants into the skin by the wearer and pumps insulin into their body. But you see, there are two types of cyberware today.  Brainware and bodyware. You know the datajack from The Matrix? Yeah, like that.  Origins Explained is the place to be to find all the answers to your questions, from mysterious events and unsolved mysteries to everything there is to know about the world and its amazing animals!",science and technology

    10 Oldest Technologies Scientists Still Can’t Explain
  ","Thousands of years ago great minds managed to create incredible technologies that were way ahead of their time, like a fire that couldn’t be extinguished by water, an unbreakable medieval sword, and even an ancient computer from 200 B.C.E.! You’d be surprised to find out what crazy inventions existed back then that science still can’t explain today.  If you’re ready to learn more about these mind-blowing ancient inventions plus a whole lot more, then keep on watching. TIMESTAMPSThe stone globes of Costa Rica 0:59The Roman dodecahedron 3:16The Phaistos Disk in Crete 4:48Greek fire 6:14Damascus steel 7:31The Iron pillar of Delhi 8:37The Viking Ulfberht sword 10:11The Voynich manuscript 11:56The Zhang Heng seismograph 14:06The Antikythera mechanism 15:12#oldtechnology #damascucsteel #vikingMusic: https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/...SUMMARY-Granodiorite rocks can easily be carved using temperature techniques. Hundreds of stone spheres were found quarried in the foothills of the Talamanca Mountains. Researchers even saw a gigantic ball weighing over 16 tons.-The Roman dodecahedron had 12 flat pentagon-shaped faces with a knob protruding on each corner. It might have been a dice, a kid’s toy, a candle holder, a simple decoration, a measuring device on the battlefield, or an astronomical instrument, to name a few.-The Phaistos Disk was made from clay and measures about 6.2 inches in diameter. Experts concluded that it was a prayer to an ancient Minoan goddess.-The formula of Greek fire was a well-guarded state secret for over 7 centuries. Greek fire was used in naval warfare.-Blades made from Damascus steel were the most sought after in medieval Europe. And that’s because they were the best swords at the time.-The Iron pillar of Delhi dates back to the Gupta period, which lasted from about 240 to 590 C.E. A small amount of rust has started to form, but it is strange that there isn’t more.-Viking Ulfberht swords are believed to have been made around 800 to 1,000 C.E., but experts were sure that the technology used to make swords of such extraordinary quality didn’t come around until 800 years later.-The Voynich manuscript has 240 pages broken up into four sections: herbal, astrological, balneological, and pharmacological. There have literally been dozens of failed attempts to crack this thing.-In 132 C.E., Zhang Heng, a Chinese inventor, astronomer, engineer, scientist, scholar, and artist, invented a seismoscope and presented it to the Han court as an instrument for measuring seasonal winds and the Earth’s movements.-The Antikythera mechanism was retrieved by a group of divers in 1900 and has been dubbed “the world’s first analog computer” and it was made around 200 B.C.E.Subscribe to Bright Side : https://goo.gl/rQTJZz----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Our Social Media:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/brightside/Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/5-Minute Crafts Youtube: https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For more videos and articles visit:http://www.brightside.me/",science and technology

    P.T-2018- How to Prepare Science & Tech.
  ","In this video Mr. Ritesh Jaiswal is analyzing syllabus of Science and tech. for UPSC. The focus of this video is to describe how to prepare for science and technology. Which important topics students have to cover and on which areas they have to concentrate more. According to him 90% of questions of sc & tech. are usually asked by technology area.इस वीडियो में अध्यापक रितेश जायसवाल द्वारा विज्ञान एवं प्रौद्योगिकी के पूरे सिलेबस की चर्चा करते हुए बताया है कि इस खंड की तैयारी के लिए विद्यार्थी क्या रणनीति अपनाएँ। तैयारी के दौरान किन महत्वपूर्ण टॉपिक्स पर पुख्ता तैयारी करने की जरूरत है और किन टॉपिक्स पर कम ध्यान देने से भी (समय की कमी की वजह से) बहुत नुकसान नहीं झेलना पड़ेगा। टॉपिक्स की एक पूरी लिस्ट इस वीडियो में बताई गई है, जिन्हें आगामी पी.टी परीक्षा के लिए तैयार करना बेहद जरूरी है। उनके मुताबिक विज्ञान एवं प्रौद्योगिकी  के 90 फीसदी सवाल प्रौद्योगिकी क्षेत्र से जुड़े हुए होते हैं।=============================•••परीक्षा की तैयारी में सहायक सामग्री, free online videos, current affairs for Hindi medium•••► तैयारी के सभी पहलुओं पे विडियो देखें  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzLq...► डा विकास दिव्यकीर्ति के वीडियो देखें (कांसेप्ट टॉक)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFsHo...► IAS परीक्षा में सफल विद्यार्थी दे रहे हैं रणनीति https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs_0-...► WhatsApp करें: अपडेट ले, नंबर है ♫► 920588 5192► सारे ऑडियो आर्टिकल्स GS कर्रेंट अफेयर्स के लिए https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0cN2...► रोजाना न्यूज़ एनालिसिस देखें https://goo.gl/G38eAZ►हिन्दू अखबार के डिबेट्स https://goo.gl/Ew1WTd►राज्य सभा TV डिस्कसन https://goo.gl/vuGMcg►PIB/PRS हिंदी में  https://goo.gl/8koHxz► मुख्या परीक्षा उत्तर लेखन अभ्यास रोज वेबसाइट पे http://www.drishtiias.com/hindi/mains...►PCS परीक्षा (BPSC, UPPSC, UK PSC, MP PSC, Jharkhand PSC) की रणनीति क्या हो https://goo.gl/unLbpw► सिविल सेवा परीक्षा, NCERT किताबें,  परीक्षा तैयारी की रणनीति, पी सी एस परीक्षा, माइंड मैप्स और परीक्षा की पूर्ण तैयारी के लिए रोज देखें  http://www.drishtiias.com/hindi►फेसबुक अपडेट: Follow Drishti IAS at https://www.facebook.com/drishtithevi...=============================Study material that is precise and totally targetted at the UPSC, PSC syllabus is provided in these crisp video notes. To the point videos are ‘short notes’ about a topic related to the syllabus. The Drishti Publications books and magazine(s) (’Drishti current affairs today’ magazine) have already successfully featured ‘to the point’ section. Here is what you can expect to gain from the ‘to the point’ videos: quick grasp of the subject matter; easy-to-understand format; knowledge of pros and cons of a topic; what, why, how, where dimensions of a topic answered. This should be very helpful for civil services syllabus (General Studies)where you need to study a vast syllabus in a short amount of time and write about 200 words in Mains answers (or do MCQs in Prelims exam).",science and technology

    25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction
  ","It’s an undeniable fact that the newest technologies such as mobile tech, genetic engineering, and the emerging field of nanotech differ from the technologies that preceded them in a fundamental way. Our world is transforming rapidly and violently to the point where many people feel completely unable to comprehend and utilize these advancements. Ironically, we witnessed many of these new “things” and technologies in sci-fi films and graphic comics first, and if someone had told us back then that it would only take a couple of decades for these changes to enter our lives, we would have probably laughed.  Think about it: Back in the early ’90s emerging computer technology was used by a limited number of people worldwide, and now, a quarter century later, everyone has a smartphone and a laptop. Can you even imagine what the world will look like in 2030, even 2050? And the scariest part of all (especially if you’re a geek like me) is the fact that science fiction, the literature of the human species encountering vast, mind-altering changes, whether they arrive via scientific discoveries, technological innovations, natural events, aliens, or societal shifts, has recently lost its magic and glimpse to the point we wonder what is real and what is not nowadays. But if you think we’re being over-dramatic, then check out these 25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction and you will see we’re not exaggerating at all.Follow us on:Twitter: https://twitter.com/list25Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/list25Website: http://list25.comInstagram: https://instagram.com/list25/Pinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/list25/Check out the physical list here: http://list25.com/25-modern-science-a...Voice control is now a trend The Cancer Gene FingerprintRobot snake automatically wraps around an object when thrownFlying carsFirst planet with FOUR suns discoveredNASA begins using robotic exoskeletonsDiamond planet discoveredArtificial leaves generate electricityVoyager I leaves the Solar SystemSelf-Driving bus is legal in Greece3-D printer creates full-size houses in one sessionDNA was photographed for the first timeGenetically modified silk is stronger than steelDARPA robot can traverse an obstacle courseLaser guns are now a realityEye implants give sight to the blindQuadriplegic successfully uses mind-controlled robotic armYou can swallow a pill-sized camera instead of invasive scopesinFORM 3-D display allows remote manipulation of physical objectsEngineers create a paper-thin robot skin that responds to touchScientists create Matrix-esque artificial wombHuman brain is hackedInvisibility cloak technology took a huge leap forwardSuperman’s view through walls becomes realityThe world’s first fully mind-controlled synthetic leg goes for a stroll",science and technology

    Fifty Years of Chinese Science and Technology
  ","Prof. Geoff Oldham reflects on his experiences over fifty years, starting with this first visit to the Chinese mainland in October 1964 when he wrote in Science magazine of “the beginning of the Chinese scientific revolution”. He recalls decades of collaborative work between SPRU and Chinese institutions through the 1970s and 80s, including research conducted on technology transfer in the oil industry and in the area of ‘clean coal technologies’, links between provincial level research and policy making, and his contributions to policy evaluations in the 1980s and 1990s that saw him working alongside Chinese and international colleagues and reporting directly to the Minister of Science and Technology. Tracing China’s changing science and technology policies from the early focus on self-reliance to the ‘catching up’ of the reform and opening period that paved the way for China’s emerging leadership and current patterns of international collaboration, his talk charts the country’s ongoing transformation and the changing role of science and technology within it. It alsos provide an account reflecting on personal memories that have shaped Professor Oldham’s perspectives on this process. The talk was part of the China Sussex Seminar Series http://www.sussex.ac.uk/newsandevents...",science and technology

Why do the world's most cerebral people find it so hard to convey their ideas? And how can we learn to do better? I suggest that answers can be found in a number of ideas from the modern sciences of mind and language. Among them are: The Tree and the Chain (how multidimensional ideas are mapped onto one-dimensional strings); The Curse of Knowledge (why it's so hard to imagine what it's like not to know something you do know); and Long Shadow of Mrs. Grundy (how to distinguish rules of proper usage that are worth keeping from those that are bogus)The first annual Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering lecture about communicating complex scientific and technological subjects clearly and engagingly in the series : Communicating Science and Technology in the 21st Century.Recorded on 9/12/12",science and technology

    William Johnson | Science and Technology of Metallic Glasses
  ","Metallic glasses are vitrified metal alloys – liquid alloys that solidify without crystallizing. Like silicate glasses and thermoplastic polymers, they exhibit a glass transition below which the liquid freezes to a solid that resists shear on practical time scales. Bulk metallic glasses developed over the past two decades, exhibit unique thermal, mechanical, and magnetic properties that make them an attractive choice for numerous engineering applications. Their glassy nature opens processing and manufacturing opportunities normally associated with plastics technology. The speaker will survey the scientific and technological evolution of metallic glasses from their inception to the present time. He will describe how metallic glass technology offers unique opportunities to change the way metals are used and commercial metal products are manufactured.William L. Johnson, the Ruben and Donna Mettler Professor of Materials Science at Caltech, joined the Caltech faculty in 1977. He received his B.A. in physics from Hamilton College and his Ph.D. in applied physics from Caltech. He spent two years at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center (1975-77) prior to joining the faculty at Caltech.Professor Johnson's research interests are centered on non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems. His research advisor was Pol Duwez, the inventor of metallic glass. In the mid-1980's, he, along with Ricardo Schwarz, discovered solid-state amorphization, leading to many years of fruitful research. His research accomplishments include the first studies of superconductivity in metallic glasses, pioneering studies of crystal to glass transformations (see Progress in Materials Science, 30, 81-134 (1986)) and seminal work on the application of thermodynamics to ion beam induced modifications of materials (Nucl. Instr. & Methods, B7, 657 (1985)).This work was followed by the synthesis of nanocrystalline and amorphous materials by high energy ball milling, and, in 1993, the discovery of bulk metallic glasses. Professor Johnson has pioneered the discovery, characterization and science of bulk metallic glass forming alloys and their use as engineering materials (see, for example, Applied Phys. Letters, 63, 2342 (1993)). His recent work has involved the development of a theory that establishes fundamental physical principles governing flow in amorphous materials. His research group is continuing to discover new bulk metallic glass forming alloys employing both experimental methods and molecular dynamic simulations to predict potential glass-forming candidates.The discovery of new glass-forming alloys cascades into a chain of scientific investigations, including the measurement of thermal, mechanical, optical, electrical and viscous properties; fundamental research into the kinetics of crystallization and glass formation, and improving the properties of monolithic bulk metallic glass through the fabricaiton of intrinsically and extrinsically toughened composites.His research has lead to commercial success, too. He is an inventor on over 25 issued patents. He is a cofounder of Liquidmetal Technologies, in Lake Forrest California, which commercialized one of Professor Johnson's BMG alloys for golf club heads (under the company name ""LiquidMetal Golf""). The company is now pursuing opportunities in cases for electronic devices. They are also expanding into the defense industry, as some of the BMG composites have demonstrated properties superior to depleted uranium as high-velocity penetrators.Professor Johnson served on the editorial board of the Journal of Rapid Solidification, and serves currently as an associate editor for Journal of Applied Physics, and Applied Physics Letters. He is a principal editor of the MRS Journal of Material Science. He is author or co-author of over 230 publications in the scientific literature, and has contributed chapters to seven books. He has held numerous consulting positions for the Department of Energy, NASA, and corporations. Over the past two decades, he has been a consultant and on numerous advisory panels for the U.S. Department of Energy, NASA, the National Science Foundation, and the National Academy of Engineering.http://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/306...",science and technology

    European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) - what's in it for researchers?
  ","The nature of science has changed. It has become interconnected, collaborative, multidisciplinary and data-intensive.The European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) has been a building block of Europe's research for 45 years. It funds research networks across borders and spanning all scientific disciplines. Because science is all about people, COST creates spaces where people are empowered and ideas can grow without limits. It connects people in high-quality networks that deliver value for money and opportunities to excel. This is a flexible and open approach focused on cooperation, which creates a unique dynamic. It creates a fertile ground for science to flourish. Academia, industry, public and private sector laboratories work together in networks, sharing knowledge, leveraging diversity and pooling resources.COST is now more relevant than ever. It is the perfect example of how governments can make a real difference, ensuring that cooperation optimises national investment in research and technology and unlocks the full potential of science.www.cost.eu",science and technology

    Creative Processes in Science and Technology: Insights from
  ","Google Tech TalkMay 14, 2009ABSTRACTCreative Processes in Science and Technology: Insights from Visual Arts.  Presented by Dr. Julio M. Ottino.Creativity is essential in art, in science, and in technology. But in what way is creativity different in these three areas, and in what way is it similar? Technology is about invention, making and building; science is about unveiling, revealing what may already be there. Philosophers, placing the emphasis on uniqueness, have declared that science is ephemeral and that art is permanent, and have placed artistic creation on the highest plane. Others have taken the same viewpoint. However, is this actually true? Or more pragmatically, are there creative processes and lessons that can be transferred across domains? In what ways do the domains intersect and enrich each other? Julio M. Ottino argues that artistic creativity reveals processes that hold lessons for scientific and technological creativity. Dr. Julio M. Ottino is the dean of the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Northwestern University where he holds the titles of Distinguished Robert R. McCormick Institute Professor and Walter P. Murphy Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering. Born in Argentina he had a career as an artist before he moved to the U.S. for his PhD in Chemical Engineering at the University of Minnesota. He then held a faculty position at UMass/Amherst and held chaired and senior appointments at Caltech, Stanford, and the University of Minnesota. He joined Northwestern in 1991 and was chairman of the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering from 1992 to 2000.

Instead of looking at where potential adversaries are heading, or coming up with the same list of technologies that we’ve come up with to research over the last 20 years, the Air Force Science and Technology strategy will seek to predict where adversaries cannot easily go and ensure that the Air Force gets there first. We will focus on advancing technology solutions along five strategic capabilities. To move the Air Force from a current force challenged by increasingly sophisticated adversaries to a force that dominates time, space and complexity in future conflict.Global persistent awareness, resilient information sharing, rapid effective decision making, complexity, unpredictability in mass, speed and reach of disruption and lethality – those concepts must drive our research as they drive our way to fight.

    College Experience Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)  Part 1 of 2
  ","Click on this link to hear the experience of a student studying at full scholarship in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) pursuing mechanical Engineering. Watch this chat show as Part 1 of 2 videos.Ansh Nasta of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology talks on Chet Chat. Ansh is studying on a full scholarship and is pursuing mechanical engineering. He shares the experience of studying at HKUST.HKUST has modern buildings, it has a very modern large campus, compared to the other Asian universities like NTU, HKU. It has a beautiful campus, right next to the sea so they enjoy both the hilly aspect as well as the seas side aspect. They have a small beach on campus too. They play soccer on the field which is right next to the sea, they sometimes have to jump in and fetch the ball. The residence halls are facing the sea as well, half of them. There are about 2000 students in each year, including 800 students in the Engineering School.One of the big advantages of studying at HKUST is the low cost. HKUST offers many scholarships to students. It doesn’t matter whether you have done IB, ICSE or CBSE, everyone can get a scholarship, only the amounts vary depending upon your grade 11 and Grade 12 marks. There is a page on the website devoted to scholarships for IB students. If you get over 35 out of 45 points in IB you are eligible for a scholarship. If you apply early, a 42 gives you a full scholarship and if you apply regular a 45 gets you a scholarship.The cost is around HKD 120,000 for international students and HKD 40,000 for local students. The government funds each child, whether they are local or international. Even the living costs are very low in Hong Kong – approx. HKD 15,000 – 20,000 per year which is very low.Mechanical Engineering is a tough program. It has an intense workload and courses are offered only once a year so you have to plan your courses in a way that you do not have to take an extra semester at the end of the four years. Mechanical Engineering has the most number of required credits as compared to other degrees.  You need to do 15 credits a semester to complete your requirements. And extra courses if you want to do a minor. Ansh intends to do a minor in business. The mechanical department offers options, you can do three courses in one area to call that your option, he is doing an option in in sustainable energy. There is a lot of flexibility allowed. HKUST has a core requirement of 36 courses out of the required 120. These include math, comp science, history, science and technology – any field or any major. The course allows you to take any course as long as you fulfil the requirements of that course.Ansh enjoyed a course in history in his first year and last summer he took a course in bitcoins that he thoroughly enjoyed. That was his favourite class. Discussion based class with external speakers was interesting.The activities that he is engaged in outside the classroom are diverse – he is the financial secretary of the art club, the internal secretary of the cuisine society.  He works with the sustainability unit, as part of the sustainability leadership program at his school he is working on a solar panel project and is now a mentor for students pursuing projects in sustainable energy. He also trains with the school track and field team and runs long distance running like 5 kms and cross country. He also plays football for the mech engineering team. He tries lots of new sports like kickboxing. HKUST has an Undergraduate research orientation program which is considered one of the best in Asia. They have a lot of funding from the government and infrastructure available to do research. Ansh has been pursuing research for the past one year under a professor on Energy harvesting.HKUST (UST) has really good sport infrastructure too, they have a football field, running track near the sea, an indoor football court too, 8 tennis courts, squash courts, badminton courts, indoor gym, table tennis tables, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, multi purpose hall for martial arts.  Student body is international compared to the Asian universities. 80% of the students are local Hong Kong students since it is government funded, 10% are mainland china students. 10% of the student body is international. This largely includes Philipines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Korea, India students but in recent years they have had lots of Europeans and Americans coming in for the experience. There are students from all around the world. Also the 80% Hong Kong students are diverse. They could be from all over the world but grew up in Hong Kong and are classified as Hong Kong Locals.Please Watch Part 2 of 2 coming soonVideo Chat with Ansh NastaHost - Chetna VasishthWe are on -YouTube.com/c/ChetChatFacebook.com/chetchat101Twitter - @chetchat101Instagram - chetchat101Google.com/+/ChetChatchetchat101@gmail.comchetchat101.tumblr.com vimeo.com/chetchataffimity.com/u/chetchat",science and technology

Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings.The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment.

So what kind of knowledge are we talking about?From the standpoint of current evolutionary theory, the human race is supposed to be at the top of the society development. However, according to the Vedic literature, in a distant past there have been civilizations in the world, the greatness of which we cannot even imagine.A detailed study of the Vedic texts was held in Bombay in 1975.It was a scientific “explosion” in physicist circles when the scientists have discovered the vivid description of subatomic level in the Vedas written some five thousand years ago.The Mahabharata, an ancient historical epic, describes the use of nuclear weapons as follows:“It was as if all the nature’s forces have been suddenly unleashed. Something dazzling like the sun revolved in circles. Burned with a heat of this weapon, the world was staggering, as in a fever.Elephants caught fire from the heat and rushed wildly hither and thither in search of protection from the terrible power. Water in the sea turned hot, the animals were dying, the foes were killed and trees were falling in rows under the fury of the forest fire. Elephants blew their trunks fiercely and fell dead on the ground. Horses and chariots were burned on the spot.Thus, thousands of enemy chariots were destroyed, and then deep silence descended on the sea. Wind began to blow and the earth shined. It was a terrible sight. The corpses of the fallen were mutilated by terrible heat so that they no longer resembled people. Never before have we seen such a terrible weapon and did not hear about it. ” (Drona-parva)The Vedic texts contain a large number of descriptions of different types of weapons, ranging from primitive stone throwing slings (sarvatobhadra), wall smashing mechanisms (udghatima), to all sorts of high velocity dart throwing devices (yantra-sara), and ending with weapons which damaging force does not have modern analogues.The tenth canto of Bhagavata Purana describes the various battles with weapons of extraordinary power. Those battles were fought by our ancient ancestors inhabited the planet, as well as representatives from other worlds.It is obvious that our ancestors were much more highly developed than we are today. Comparing to them we look like babies, at least in technical terms.It appeared that the city was well-protected even in terms of today’s scientific advancement.In Vedic literature there are many references to flying saucers. In general, they are called the vimana. Vimanas in the Vedas are divided into two categories:1) the mechanical machines, similar to airplanes and flying with wings like a bird;2) and very complex machines that can not be precisely classified, which had unlimited possibilities.Machines of the first category are described mainly in medieval writings in Sanskrit, along with other various automatic devices and military machines.There were robots designed in the form of male and female figures that performed various functions. They were made mostly of wood, but perfectly covered with humanlike skin. Their motions were provided by the system of bolts, iron rods, springs and grooves. These figures played musical instruments, served drinks to guests and did other similar services.Yantrapurusha or man-machine could behave exactly like a real human. It is described in Bhagaya-vastu how an artist visited home of the yantracharya, or a teacher of mechanical engineering. There he was met by a robot-girl who washed his feet and had a resemblance of a real person until he realized that she was unable to speak. However, it is known that there were even speaking and absolutely fantastic sounding robots.Are we able now, with all our modern science and computer technology, to repeat a similar level of inventive skill? Can we believe that the technical progress, as it is described in the Vedas, has really existed on Earth? Are Sanskrit texts the only proof of greatness of that ancient civilization?",science and technology

    History of Food Science & Technology [For Beginners]
  ","Do you know that most of the food we see on the shelf of the supermarkets today, wasn’t available a 100-150 years from now? This was because there were very few techniques to preserve the food. The food would spoil very fast and a lot of people suffered from food poisoning and even death. The food we eat today, is completely taken for granted because it is cheap and easily available. The food you and I are eating today has been possible because of the efforts of a lot of scientists, researchers, engineers, food technologists, nutritionists so that the food you are eating is safe and healthy. But the process of developing food wasn’t invented overnight. So, what is the history and how food technology originated?Well if you ask me, I think the preservation of food has been abundant since early human started farming. Early humans realized the fact that they could not always hunt for animals or pluck fruits from trees every day. And if they stored the food like meat, it spoiled very fast. So, they had to develop some preservation techniques for eating the food even when they could not hunt, or the fruits and vegetables weren’t available.Some of the earliest preservation techniques include Sun-Drying, freezing, salting, fermentation and so on. The downside of the early preservation techniques was that they changed the flavour and texture of the food along with huge loss of vitamins most of the time. These techniques were not very effective for travellers and soldiers who needed a healthy diet. During the Napoleonic wars (1803-1815), the French Government offered 12,000 Francs to anyone who could develop a method for preserving food for the military. In 1809, a French confectioner and chef developed a method of sealing the food in glass jars. The name of that French man was ‘Nicholas Appert’. The process was simple. He sealed the food in a glass jar and then heated the jar for some time depending upon the food. The method proved to be successful and he was awarded 12,000 Francs. The invention of canning is considered as the major turning point in the history of food technology and food science. Because of his remarkable contribution, Nicholas Appert is also known as the ‘Father of Canning’. And even canning is sometimes referred to as ‘Appertization’. Although canning was successful but the science behind its success wasn’t known until 50 years later, when a French microbiologist and chemist showed that growth of micro-organisms is responsible for the spoilage of beverages. He also invented a process where milk was heated to a specific temperature for a specified time to kill the spoilage micro-organisms. That French microbiologist was none other than Louis Pasteur. The process he invented is still prevalent in the dairy industry and wine industry as well. And in the honour of Louis Pasteur, the process is known as ‘Pasteurization’. In 1895, almost a 30 years later in Boston, Massachusetts, William Lyman Underwood of a canning company worked with Samuel Prescott to develop the research which would further lead to the concept of ‘Thermal Death Time’. A lot of people don’t consider this event when it comes to the history of food technology, but this was also one of the turning points in the history as their research was important to determine the time-temperature combination for a food. That means, for how long a food will be cooked at what temperature. Since then, a lot of research and discoveries had been done but in the 20th century, food safety was still an issue. In 1960, the Pillsbury company, NASA and the USA army labs collaborated to develop safe and healthy food for the astronauts. Eventually, they developed a systematic preventive approach to ensure food safety and that came to be known as ‘HACCP’. HACCP is a preventive tool used in food industry to ensure safety of the food.HACCP is prevalent today in every food industry and food safety is incomplete without the implementation of the HACCP program. Since the development of HACCP, there have been a lot of rapid growth in the food technology. Industrialists have adopted newer technologies to process the food in a faster and efficient way. So, these were some of the major breakthroughs in the history of food technology.-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-Please watch: ""What Is Food Safety & Why You Need to Know About It?"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQLvn...-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",science and technology

    Dr.John Hagelin: Veda and Physics: The Science and Technology of the Unified Field
  ","John Hagelin (Ph.D. Quantum Physics) addresses the International Conference to Re-Establish Vedic India, 20 February, 2015 on Veda and Physics: The Science and Technology of the Unified Field.Summary points: Vedic Science in Our Modern WorldVedic Science is scientific, practical, and indispensable in this modern age. The Vedic tradition is founded upon the complete knowledge and practical application of the ultimate reality—the unified field.Modern physics has systematically explored finer levels of creation, smaller and smaller time and distance scales, from the classical macroscopic world to the atomic and nuclear levels, culminating in the discovery of one underlying unified field of existence at the basis of all diversity in the universe.Ancient Vedic science has likewise explored finer and finer levels of mind and matter, culminating in the discovery and direct experience of one unified field of life—the field of transcendental existence, or pure consciousness. This unbounded field of pure knowledge is known as Veda.Are the unified field and Veda one and the same reality? Both sciences, one ancient and subjective and the other modern and objective, describe manifest creation as an expression of infinite dynamism embedded in the infinite silence of the underlying field. Physics describes this relationship in terms of the unified field and vacuum energy, and Vedic Science in terms of Shiva and Shakti.Similarly, at every level of manifest creation, these two descriptions of nature’s functioning correspond exactly. Physics describes three superfields giving rise to the five spin types that characterize elementary particles, the resonant frequencies of the unified field and building blocks of creation; Vedic Science speaks of the three Prakritis or Doshas giving rise to the five Mahabhutas that structure the universe.Moreover, this correspondence extends to the unmanifest level as well—the self-interacting dynamics of the underlying field. The structure of Rk Veda unfolds sequentially from initial wholeness to 8 to 24 to 64 to 192 elaborations. Similarly, superstring theory in physics describes 8 fundamental vibrational modes of the unified field, which unfold sequentially to 24, 64, and 192 degrees of freedom within the field.This correspondence is intriguing, but how can it be practically applied? The ancient Vedic technologies of consciousness, revived by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, allow anyone to gain direct experiential access to the unified field on the level of consciousness and to apply this holistic experience to all aspects of daily life and living.The process of transcending—moving from articulated thought (Vaikari) to abstract conceptual thought (Madhyama) to fine feeling (Pashyanti) to pure consciousness, the Self (Atma)—provides the experience of levels of mind at each level corresponding to mathematical structures that have evolved sequentially to describe these more abstract levels of existence.Yoga, at its deepest level, is the experience of transcendence (Samadhi)—the union of individual awareness with cosmic intelligence through the effortless transcending process embodied in the TM technique.This experience of transcendence is a fourth major state of consciousness, a “wakeful hypo-metabolic state” of profound EEG coherence and deep physiological rest, which has been shown through extensive scientific research to produce wide-ranging, measurable benefits for mental and physical health, as well as significant cost savings for health care.Modern pharmacological approaches to health care operate on the chemical level, but Vedic approaches to health care (Ayurveda, Yoga) operate at the level of the unified field. These are Atma-based, unified field-based approaches, with correspondingly greater efficacy and power.Similarly, Vedic approaches to education, defense, and civilization as a whole are Atma-based, unified field-based approaches, completely holistic and free from negative side effects. Thus the Vedic tradition is founded upon the complete knowledge and practical application of ultimate reality—the unified field.",science and technology

    College Experience Hong Kong University of Science and Technology - Part 2 of 2
  ","Click on this link to hear the experience of a student studying at full scholarship in Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) pursuing mechanical Engineering. Watch this chat show as Part 2 of 2 videos.Ansh Nasta of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology talks on Chet Chat. Ansh is studying on a full scholarship and is pursuing mechanical engineering. He shares the experience of studying at HKUST.Coming to Jobs, another advantage of studying in Hong Kong is availability of Jobs, visa, internships etc. Ansh says that jobs in Hong Kong pay a lot, some students can pay their living expenses because of a well-paying job. Most common part time job for students is to become a tutor for other IB students, and this is very well paying and helps take care of boarding and living expenses.The language requirement for most jobs is English, though they prefer if you know Cantonese. However, there are many students who have well-paying jobs without knowing Chinese. It is very easy to get a work visa once you have studied there, also the job placements are very good. Most international students have job offers in hand a few months before they graduate and very good salaries.Intense research culture, jobs being available, salaries being good, visas being easily available and cost being low make it a very attractive place to study in.Asian culture is unique and different from the American and British universities. They are very academic and it is very difficult to score good grades. Students are graded on a curve and it is very tough to get a GPA over 3.0. The Chinese students spend most of their time studying and for them university is about studying. If they pursue any activity they will take up only one activity and pursue it very seriously. They are much focussed.There is no fraternity culture, there are clubs and societies, though international students are not welcome for most of these. The language is mostly in Chinese. At the Business school lectures are discussion based. In Engineering school there are less international professors, there are more Chinese professors. In their culture subordination is key. Professors at the top, students below. So you are not supposed to question a professor in class. If you give the right answer in class, they think you are showing off. Students don’t like to speak in class.Language of Instruction is English, but given 80% Cantonese. Most activities are conducted in Cantonese like clubs, movie nights, trekking activities etc. are all conducted in Cantonese. Most students have learnt English but they find it very difficult to speak in English since English is either their second or third language. So they prefer sticking amongst themselves. Even if they know how to speak in English they are very reluctant, since in their culture if you make a mistake people make fun of you, so they are afraid that the international students will make fun of them so they prefer to speak in Cantonese.Ansh started learning Cantonese to merge with them, and that made a big difference since they found an international student is trying to learn Cantonese and trying to speak with us, they get more friendly with you. Even with sports, may Indian students do not participate in sports, they are usually more involved in partying or studying. Ansh is one of the few international students who is serious about his extra curriculars. Even mainland Chinese students have always studied in Mandarin so most of them learn English just before coming to college, just to get admission.The food on campus is local Chinese food that is not very spicy. Food places outside campus can be quite expensive. Ansh travelled around Hong Kong researching good food less than HKD 50 or 100. HE enjoyed the food since Hong Kong is a very diverse place for food, a huge varieties of cuisines. He now tries to cook his own food and became the director of the cuisine society to initiate more activities with people who are as passionate about food.The social scene on campus is also very different. Their idea of partying is not drinking and dancing but playing games and eating good food. So most International students go out for partying. In Hong Kong the two main partying areas are Wanchai and Lan Kwan Fong, both have a very international feel, where many international students party. Hiking is a great fun activity in Hong Kong. You can hike in the middle of the city, in five minutes you can be from a station to a mountain. There are hiking trails and maps available which make hiking a great activity in Hong Kong.  ‘Crazy’ is the one word in which he describes his school – crazy academic and crazy diverse.

  ","The project to establish the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology was first announced in June 2001 by the Minister of State for Okinawa and Northern Territories Affairs and the Minister of State for Science and Technology Policy. The Japanese Cabinet Office promotes the project with the following three objectives:Firstly, to establish in Japan a leading center for research and education that will address new challenges in science and technology. Having achieved economic development through technological innovation, Japan is keen to make significant contributions to the advancement of science and technology. Today, many emerging fields of science and technology require multidisciplinary research. The Institute will focus on integrative approaches to high level research and education. Secondly, to provide a successful model of a research university for Japanese academia. Existing universities with rigid departmental structures face difficulties in developing new systems to accommodate integrative research and education. An additional challenge is to establish a fully internationalized environment. Aside from the Institute holding lectures in English, the Institute will encourage the use of English as the working language of the graduate university. It is hoped that the infusion of differing cultural mindsets will develop a creative atmosphere that nurtures an original and questing spirit.Thirdly, to stimulate the economic transformation of Okinawa. As Okinawa moves beyond the 30th anniversary of Reversion to Japan (2002), the need to develop a self-sustaining, private-sector-driven economy is clear. As an integral step in this process, the Institute aims jump start the development of an industrial and technological cluster. Okinawa's beautiful natural surroundings and geographical proximity to several East-Asian metropolis provide an ideal setting for a world-class university.",science and technology

    Will science and technology save the world?
  ","The green revolution in agriculture has freed hundreds of millions around the world from the risk of starvation. The Internet is providing knowledge-on-tap to people as never before. Lifespans have doubled due to remarkable progress in medicine. New desalination techniques are poised to solve problems of shortage of fresh water. Our remaining resource problems can be solved by synthetic biology, nanoscale molecular manufacturing, and asteroid mining. The threat of climate change can be tamed by carbon capture and geoengineering. Although doomsayers are distracted by rolling news stories that highlight human failings in graphic terms, the big picture is that science and technology are changing the world into a much better place. Right?Not every futurist is convinced by this techno-optimistic narrative. Here's a forceful critique by renowned speaker, blogger, and interviewer, Nikola Danaylov:[Quote]I am tired of hearing that science and technology will save the world.It is almost the same as saying “Jesus will save you!”It evokes the very same passive quasi-religious hope that something or someone out there will magically solve all our problems, bring abundance in our lives, help us live forever and bring back the dead.I am sorry to break this to you but science and technology will not save the world. Never have...Our civilization is like an alcoholic with a failing liver – we hope we can 3d bio-print a new one just in time, while failing to acknowledge our self-destructive habits and our own responsibility, thereby failing to address the actual problem, rather than the symptom.It’s like hoping to win the lottery – it’s not totally impossible, but it is almost certain we won’t. (And even if we do, then what? It will only provide more time, not necessarily a solution.)And so we sit, and wait, and hope for science and technology to come save the world. And we are getting both fat and lazy as we are eating and driving ourselves to death. Both personally and collectively.[End Quote](You can read more of Nikola's article at https://www.singularityweblog.com/tec....)In this London Futurists online video conference, a number of futurists from around the world debated questions such as:*) What are the risks of over-reliance on technology?*) What are the risks of under-reliance on technology?*) What goals should be set for the use of science and technology?*) To what extent is it desirable to try to regulate the development and use of technology?*) What are the most effective methods to steer the development of technology?

    Great Women in Technology | Daniela Rus | TEDxMIT
  ","Studies have shown that not only do additional voices bring more ideas, but that the act of adding diversity to a group helps people see that different perspectives exist and therefore adapt their behavior. Diversity encourages people to anticipate different perspectives, work harder to reach a consensus, and often achieve better outcomes. But diversity alone isn’t enough. Studies have shown that women struggle to get the same opportunities for career advancement or even the same pay as their male counterparts.  Many feel excluded by a sexist work culture.  And few fail to notice the lack of women in senior leadership roles in most technology organizations.  It’s up to us—the people, the researchers, the professors, the students the entrepreneurs, and the business leaders—to cause change, to create a truly inclusive environment where everyone feels part of the whole. Daniela Rus is the Andrew (1956) and Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT. Rus’ research interests are in robotics, artificial intelligence, and data science.The focus of her work is developing the science and engineering of autonomy, toward the long-term objective of enabling a future with machines pervasively integrated into the fabric of life, supporting people with cognitive and physical tasks. Her research addresses some of the gaps between where robots are today and the promise of pervasive robots: increasing the ability of machines to reason, learn, and adapt to complex tasks in human-centered environments, developing intuitive interfaces between robots and people, and creating the tools for designing and fabricating new robots quickly and efficiently. The applications of this work are broad and include transportation, manufacturing, agriculture, construction, monitoring the environment, underwater exploration, smart cities, medicine, and in-home tasks such as cooking.Rus serves as the Associate Director of MIT’s Quest for Intelligence Core, and as Director of the Toyota-CSAIL Joint Research Center, whose focus is the advancement of AI research and its applications to intelligent vehicles. She is a member of the Toyota Research Institute advisory board.Rus is a Class of 2002 MacArthur Fellow, a fellow of ACM, AAAI and IEEE, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She is the recipient of the 2017 Engelberger Robotics Award from the Robotics Industries Association. She earned her PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University.Rus has also worked on two collaborative projects with the Pilobolus Dance company at the intersection of Technology and Art. Seraph, a pastoral story about human-machine friendship, was choreographed in 2010 and performed in 2010-2011 in Boston and New York City. The Umbrella Project, a participatory performance exploring group behavior, was choreographed in 2012 and performed at PopTech 2012, in Cambridge, Baltimore, and Singapore.

    What if technologies shaped the law? [Science and Technology podcast]
  ","Εxploring the relationship between law, technological innovation and regulatory governance has always been a challenging task for policy-makers. Technologies are often seen as ordinary objects of formal law that can fit into the traditional doctrinal classification. But what if technologies were legal artefacts that question and challenge the traditional boundaries of legal thought? Some scholars even argue that technology is law, given that the employment of technology for control purposes in regulation provides opportunities to directly or indirectly shape human behaviour in legal terms. However, it is difficult to determine whether it is technology that challenges the law or the law that shapes or even predefines the development paths of new and emerging technologies.Subscribe to EPRS Science and Technology Podcasts:http://www.europarl.europa.eu/rss/en/...",science and technology

    Great Women in Technology | Daniela Rus | TEDxMIT
  ","Studies have shown that not only do additional voices bring more ideas, but that the act of adding diversity to a group helps people see that different perspectives exist and therefore adapt their behavior. Diversity encourages people to anticipate different perspectives, work harder to reach a consensus, and often achieve better outcomes. But diversity alone isn’t enough. Studies have shown that women struggle to get the same opportunities for career advancement or even the same pay as their male counterparts.  Many feel excluded by a sexist work culture.  And few fail to notice the lack of women in senior leadership roles in most technology organizations.  It’s up to us—the people, the researchers, the professors, the students the entrepreneurs, and the business leaders—to cause change, to create a truly inclusive environment where everyone feels part of the whole. Daniela Rus is the Andrew (1956) and Erna Viterbi Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT. Rus’ research interests are in robotics, artificial intelligence, and data science.The focus of her work is developing the science and engineering of autonomy, toward the long-term objective of enabling a future with machines pervasively integrated into the fabric of life, supporting people with cognitive and physical tasks. Her research addresses some of the gaps between where robots are today and the promise of pervasive robots: increasing the ability of machines to reason, learn, and adapt to complex tasks in human-centered environments, developing intuitive interfaces between robots and people, and creating the tools for designing and fabricating new robots quickly and efficiently. The applications of this work are broad and include transportation, manufacturing, agriculture, construction, monitoring the environment, underwater exploration, smart cities, medicine, and in-home tasks such as cooking.Rus serves as the Associate Director of MIT’s Quest for Intelligence Core, and as Director of the Toyota-CSAIL Joint Research Center, whose focus is the advancement of AI research and its applications to intelligent vehicles. She is a member of the Toyota Research Institute advisory board.Rus is a Class of 2002 MacArthur Fellow, a fellow of ACM, AAAI and IEEE, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She is the recipient of the 2017 Engelberger Robotics Award from the Robotics Industries Association. She earned her PhD in Computer Science from Cornell University.Rus has also worked on two collaborative projects with the Pilobolus Dance company at the intersection of Technology and Art. Seraph, a pastoral story about human-machine friendship, was choreographed in 2010 and performed in 2010-2011 in Boston and New York City. The Umbrella Project, a participatory performance exploring group behavior, was choreographed in 2012 and performed at PopTech 2012, in Cambridge, Baltimore, and Singapore.

  ","Technology (from Greek τέχνη, techne, ""art, skill, cunning of hand""; and -λογία, -logia[3]) is the collection of techniques, methods or processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, etc. or it can be embedded in machines, computers, devices and factories, which can be operated by individuals without detailed knowledge of the workings of such things.The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans in travelling in and controlling their environment. Recent technological developments, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. However, not all technology has been used for peaceful purposes; the development of weapons of ever-increasing destructive power has progressed throughout history, from clubs to nuclear weapons.Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. In many societies, technology has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products, known as pollution, and deplete natural resources, to the detriment of Earth's environment. Various implementations of technology influence the values of a society and new technology often raises new ethical questions. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, a term originally applied only to machines, and the challenge of traditional norms.Philosophical debates have arisen over the present and future use of technology in society, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar movements criticise the pervasiveness of technology in the modern world, opining that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. Indeed, until recently, it was believed that the development of technology was restricted only to human beings, but recent scientific studies indicate that other primates and certain dolphin communities have developed simple tools and learned to pass their knowledge to other generations.Watch more: https://goo.gl/5SCZ6z   *** *** *** *** *** ***************************************************Thanks for WatchingPlease Like and Subscribe to Watch more videos",science and technology

    Skolkovo Foundation - Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology
  ","http://sk.ru/en Skolkovo, Moscow 13.12.2010The plan for SkITech drew on the experience of a Skolkovo partner, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology among others. As well as the standard requirement to ensure the optimal correlation of auditoriums, laboratories, libraries and accommodation blocks and to make them comfortable and beautiful, the architects were set the objective of creating an area that would be suitable for project work and at the same time integrated into the urban environment.The planning for the institute does not assume the existence of a rigid structure dependent on departments, which is a novelty for Russia. The students and teaching staff will be able to walk from the auditorium straight onto the Central Boulevard -- the busiest street in the city -- or enjoy the calm of quite internal yards. A well designed system of pedestrian links will enable people to move around the institute with minimum loss of time.The celebrated architectural practice Herzog & de Meuron Architekten (Basel, Switzerland) has been engaged to work on planning the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology campus. It is well known for projects such as the Tate Modern gallery, which won the firm's founders the Pritzker Prize for achievements in architecture, the Media Centre library at Brandenburg University in Cottbus, and the National Olympic Stadium in Beijing.The campus will cover about 60 hectares.",science and technology

    The contrasting roles of science and technology in environmental challenges
  ","The contrasting roles of science and technology in environmental challenges by Nikolaos Voulvoulis & Mark A. Burgmanpublished at Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/...Sustainable development is widely recognised as an existential challenge. To address it, humanity needs to change its ways. However, people seem slow to act, not always understanding and often denying environmental imperatives, creating substantial social and psychological barriers. Social inertia and denial have been allegedly amplified by a public discourse increasingly distrustful of science. But is this discourse a rejection of science or an erosion of trust in how science is applied? The paper examines the main differences between environmental science and technology, reviews how the wider science- technology convergence has affected them and evaluates potential implications for sustainability challenges. We question whether the ‘convergence’ between environmental science and technology, could be behind the growing public dissatisfaction and distrust of environmental science and policies. Although environmental science plays a role in enabling understanding and communicating complexity, technology requires political, social and economic skills, beyond conventional disciplinary expertise. To avoid putting academic freedom at risk, environmental technologists, a new breed of professionals, should have a clear understanding of scientific capacity and uncertainty and be able to engage with stakeholders, policy makers and the public to design integrated, interdisciplinary and holistic solutions, and also better define the many environmental problems we face.",science and technology

    Science and Technology for Supporting Decisions in Natural Disasters | Bijan Khazai | TEDxKIT
  ","Disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons and floods have devastating impacts on a community’s ability to thrive. Actionable decisions to prepare for, respond to and recover from natural disasters require a personalized understanding of risk. Most existing catastrophe risk assessment models consume huge amounts of time and data and are costly to use. They are commonly applied for assessment of high-value facilities, but numerous small and medium enterprises throughout disaster prone regions typically do not have the capacity and financial means to employ these modeling tools and services. Opening up risk models to a wider community and communicating risk outputs in a way that is useful to ordinary citizens and businesses can play a pivotal role in being better prepared for natural disasters.Dr. Bijan Khazai is a research scientist at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology’s (KIT) Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM). He holds Masters and Doctoral degrees in Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley, where he worked on developing GIS-based landslide hazard assessment models in the San Francisco Bay Area. Dr. Khazai’s research interests are social vulnerability analysis, megacity and urban risk, and information technology for post-disaster recovery planning. As a project specialist for Earthquake and Megacities Initiative (EMI), he has worked in a number of applied projects in Istanbul, Amman and Metro Manila and Mumbai.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

    Shay Locomotive - Canada Museum of Science and Technology
  ","The Shay Geared Steam Locomotive, one of one hundred and sixteen known to remain worldwide (another five questionable and another six Willamette style Shays), was originally conceived by the American lumber merchant Ephraim Shay. The patent was sold to Lima Machine Works (eventually Locomotive Works Inc.) of Lima, Ohio who refined the concept and produced 2,768 Shays over a period of 67 years (1878-1945). The museum's Shay is composed of parts from two locomotives, one constructed in 1923, and the other in 1925. Both were constructed for the Merrill & Ring Lumber Co., Ltd and used in forestry operations at Theodosia Arm, British Columbia. The Shay was branded as the ""strong man of the woods"" because of its distinctive and unique mechanical workings, making it highly efficient in the logging industry. Immediately noticeable is the Shay's offset boiler to the left, positioned there in order to make room for the three cylinder engine mounted vertically on the right. The engine's pistons turn the crank shaft which is connected on both ends by universal and slip joints to the line shafts on the front and rear trucks. These transmit power to both axles on each truck by way of bevel gearing. Thus, all wheels are driven and produce tractive  or pulling  force of 22,580 pounds (10, 242 Kg), allowing the Shay to move along the steep grades of British Columbia's mountainous terrain while hauling substantial loads. With its flexible (pivoting and rotating) trucks, extra wide tires on each wheel and all axles powered design, the Shay Geared Steam Locomotive was able to negotiate the unrefined forestry railways that would easily stop or derail a conventional rod locomotive.",science and technology

    Postdoc's dorm room at POSTECH (Pohang University of Science and Technology)
  ","This video shows the accommodation (provided at the rate of KRW 200,000 per month) to postdoctoral researchers whose marital status is single. This episode shows most of the amenities and furnishings in the private room. Be sure to watch the other video too, which shows surroundings outside of the private room. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=...)I made this video to show what it looks like because I was never told anything about the accommodation, other than that the university had signed me up for it without my explicit permission. I had no idea about its location, or what it looked like, or anything. This video attempts to give you an idea of what the provided accommodation looks like, including amenities and room furnishing. It should help you in your packing. Since I was told nothing, I did not know what to bring. I will explain the pro's and con's. (In fact, other than being told that the university had automatically signed up for housing, I was not given ANY detail about the accommodation until 2 days before my postdoc contract started. In fact, three days before my contract started, I had received an e-mail stating ""your accommodation hasn't been decided yet.  Tomorrow, the housing office wil let me know. So then i will give you the address."")There was a deposit amount of KRW 300,000.The video shows the content of the room. On the door is an electronic lock system. You can set a personal code to use to unlock the door. It is convenient because you never have to carry a key (other than the key card to get in and out of the building's main entrance). It is big enough to fit the provided furniture (bed, desk, orange chair, refrigerator, wash basin, large closet, small closet). It is not big enough to fit in anything else.At least the room is furnished, but you will have to provide your own bed sheets and pillow.There is not even enough room on the ground to fit in a spare mattress for an overnight visitor (and I suppose this partially explains why the building's policy is to have no overnight guests).What is not clear from this video is that this building (Male dormitory building 19) is in close proximity to other dorm buildings, including freshmen dorms. On any night of the week, at ANY hour, it is likely that very loud, rude, and drunk college students will walk between the buildings and wake you up.Overall, the provided accommodation is extremely bad and shameful for a first-rate university to provide as housing for its postdocs. Should you come here, at least you can use these videos to see what you will get. (The contract which you must sign, which you don't get to see before coming, stipulates that you'll live in the provided accommodation for at least 6 months.)What's also very interesting is that the four nearby high-rise GRADUATE STUDENT APARTMENTS are much nicer than these, with private kitchens, bathrooms, and several bedrooms. I hope the university wisens up and treats us postdocs the way we deserve to be treated.",science and technology

    Electronic Sackbut Synthesizer - Canada Museum of Science and Technology
  ","Hugh LeCaine of Ottawa created the Electronic Sackbut Synthesizer in his home studio over a period of three years from 1945 to 1948. This synthesizer is the first voltage-controlled synthesizer ever built, preceding the manufacture of commercial synthesizers by twenty years. Le Caine, a nuclear physicist with the National Research Council, was passionate about music. He was concerned that the musical notes produced by electronic instruments in the 1930s, such as the Hammond Organ and the Morse Robb Wave Organs, lacked a certain expressivity. Determined to shape technology for the needs of the musician and expand the possibilities of musical sound he built a synthesizer that allows for complex variations in pitch and tone. This, LeCaine achieved, through the innovative use of voltage control. The technique provides an automatic background voltage that can remain stable or be altered through the manipulation of the knobs and keyboard. The keys are sensitive to a vertical pressure that controls the volume and a lateral pressure that changes the pitch. In this way the musician can simultaneously manipulate the volume, pitch, and timbre of each note and produce gradual transitions from one sound to the next. The rudimentary appearance of the synthesizer  its three legs made of crossed pieces of scrap wood and with instructions penciled onto its surface  camouflages the brilliant concept behind this invention. LeCaine's Electronic Sackbut Synthesizer is the precursor of today's electronic instruments.",science and technology

    UW Master of Science in Technology Innovation
  ","From smart homes to smart health, connected devices are transforming our daily lives and powering innovation across the globe. UW’s Master of Science in Technology Innovation teaches you how to design, develop and launch the connected solutions of the future. The MSTI is offered by the Global Innovation Exchange, a new partnership between the UW and Tsinghua University in China, with support from Microsoft. GIX brings students, faculty and industry professionals together to collaborate on solutions to global challenges such as sustainability and health care. Learn more at http://www.techinnovationdegree.uw.edu.Video Transcript:[Shwetak] What the MSTI, or the master’s of science and technology innovation degree, is all about is to really provide a broad understanding of what it means to innovate on a piece of technology. This includes the design aspect of it. How do you know that you're building the right thing and how you're building it right? But also prototyping. How do you know that the thing that you're trying to build is even feasible? So appreciating hardware and software development so that you know that this thing can even be built. And then pitching it, and then getting funding for it. So the entrepreneurial side of how do you launch a venture like this. And so the program is designed to integrate across all three of these different areas in an offering where a student can do it in one specific degree.[Linda] I think increasingly, in the pace of innovation and development in the technology fields, there's a growing expectation that any one person has a more rounded skillset, that has some of each of those in their skillset. And those are the professionals and the emerging students that are in more demand.The program is a 15-month program, so you would start in the fall, go the full four quarters and then a fifth quarter which is your launch phase.[Shwetak] So the first 12 months is you'll be iterating on a number of different projects, and you learn the, just the basics through these classes and tutorials.[Linda] Each quarter there's going to be a range of classes from some sort of very specific hands-on studios, something maybe as specific as a hardware-software lab or something about micro-controllers, to a design-thinking studio, which is going to be more processed based.[Shwetak] In the last three months of the 15-month period is what we call the launch phase. So you really settle on a particular project that you want to take it to the next level.It could be that you're working on a project that's sponsored by a corporation. It can be something where the student comes in and has their own idea, recruits students within the cohort to help them with their project that might get them to a point where they start to maybe spin out a company at the end of the program.[Linda] UW has a fantastic reputation for being the most innovative public university, which is wonderful. There's such a great embracing and support structure here at the University, and in Seattle more broadly, for innovation, for startups.[Shwetak] One of the things that's interesting about this program is not just the top faculty engaging with the students, but it's also the mentors and the, and the technologists and the thought leaders in the Pacific Northwest. This includes members of the venture capital community. It includes engineers and thought leaders at companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Boeing.[Linda] So there's a really, a coalescing of that energy, those services, that perspective, that experience in the community here from industry, that GIX will be able to tap into.[Shwetak] So the MSTI is housed within the Global Innovation Exchange.[Linda] GIX, Global Innovation Exchange, is a unique partnership between University of Washington, Tsinghua University and industry partners, most notably Microsoft. It encompasses a new type of interdisciplinary degree program that is much more team- and project-based, hands-on, to develop a closer partnership between industry partners and the educational experience and to really bring together kind of three different domains: technical innovation, an entrepreneurship lens and understanding of the business landscape.[Shwetak] And so we're looking at how do we engage the larger community? Not just the local community, but the global community, to create these really innovative graduate programs that allow students to solve these real-world problems and do it in such a way that's global in spirit.[Linda] So I'm really excited also about the facility that is being developed that will have maker space, and team spaces, studio facilities, you know, be state-of-the-art in terms of technology. It's really going to be a fantastic place for industry, faculty and students to come and work and engage and collaborate.[Shwetak] This program is really designed to teach people how to become innovators.",science and technology

    Master of Technology Management: Engineering, Science and Entrepreneurship
  ","For more information: http://www.mtm.ucsb.eduThe best technology-based companies don't have a hard time finding employees to work on technical projects and investors see no shortage of entrepreneurs with good ideas for products but executives and investors both agree that they can't often find engineers and scientists who have what it takes to build the business around their new technologies. When looking to develop business and management skills, engineers and scientists are faced with an unfortunate decision between two choices: hope there's some day given a chance to develop leadership abilities on the job or to get an MBA and risk losing touch with their technical roots.  At UC Santa Barbara we've created a third choice--a better choice.  The UC Santa Barbara's Master of Technology Management Program was built with chief one important goal: to catapult early career engineers toward becoming leaders in technology ventures, both within established companies and startups.  To build the Master of Technology Management Program we asked dozens of large technology companies like Google, Facebook, Oracle, Tesla, JDS Uniphaseas well as founders of many small tech startups what skills engineers and scientists need to become successful entrepreneurs and effective change agents within large firms then we carefully crafted a curriculum that help students to develop those skills in just nine months. Our Master of Technology Management Program is geared specifically to teach students about how to lead technical ventures both new companies and established technology companies.We focus with laser precision on thinking about how do you manage technical enterprise and technical workers.  The MTM curriculum provides the frameworks and skills that will allowyou to comfortably tack between start-up activities within established companies and start-up activities as an entrepreneur.  Our program focuses on the intersection of Technology Management where people products and processes meet.  Work is all about collaboration. Very few things are individual effort the hardest projects we do at Sonos are around getting the highly cross functional teams working and collaborating well together. That was a huge skill I learned at UCSB.  Our award-winning faculty is composed of nationally recognized scholars andteachers in the field of technology management who have invested in, founded, lead and consulted for tech ventures.  Their real-world experiences allow them to speak directly to issues that students will face in their jobs.  Our core faculty is fully committed to the development of our Master of Technology Management students. That means office hours, extracurricular events, even hallway conversations are centered on you and your classmates.  We accept only the most talented and highly qualified early career engineers and scientists from around the world.  We look for individuals who have distinguished themselves as technology experts and have demonstrated leadership potential.  You'll be moving through the nine-month intensive curriculum as a single cohort with smart, ambitious individuals just like you.  UC Santa Barbara's technology management program is the only management program in the world designed exclusively for engineers and scientists.  If your ideal career path is one in which you build technology,  focus leadership skills on top of your existing technical talents,  this is the program for you.  Today's tech companies are looking for tomorrow's leaders.  Will you be ready to meet the demand?  To learn more or to submit an application, visit us at mtm.ucsb.edu today.",science and technology

    White House Office of Science & Technology Policy, 25th Anniversary Symposium (pt.3) MIT 5/1/2001
  ","The 25th anniversary of the White House OSTP is celebrated at MIT with a day-long symposium on science and technology policy, held on May 1, 2001. Talks and panel discussions are presented throughout the day by eight former presidential science policy advisors who speak on issues they faced while in office, and by other distinguished speakers who offer a prospective look at science and technology policy concerns.During the day's afternoon session, titled “Cross-Cutting Issues,” the audience hears from: • Rita Rossi Colwell, “Confronting the Human Capital Crisis: Tapping the Talent” (Director, National Science Foundation);• William Wolf, “New Engineering Ethics: Great Achievements and Grand Challenges” (President, National Academy of Engineering);• Prof. Daniel E. Hastings, “Technology and Policy Education Needs” (Director, Technology Policy Program, MIT Engineering Systems Division; MIT AeroAstro);• Charles Holland, “Defense Technology” (Director of Information Systems, Dept. of Defense);• Institute Professor Phillip Sharp (speaking about political issues and biotechnology);• David D. Clark, “Internet Communications and Information Technology” (Senior Research Scientist, MIT LCS); • Prof. Ronald Prinn, “The Greenhouse Gamble” (Director, MIT EAPS).MIT President Charles M. Vest concludes the symposium. The White House OSCP was established by Congress in 1976 to provide the President and others within the Executive Office of the President with advice on the scientific, engineering, and technological aspects of the economy, national security, homeland security, health, foreign relations, the environment (including global climate change), and the technological recovery and use of resources, among other topics.

    Rheinmetall ROSY at DSTL live demo on Challenger 2
  ","Rheinmetall’s ROSY smoke protection system on Challenger 2 at a live demo of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory  (DSTL): ROSY helps to protect the crew and passengers of military and civilian vehicles from surprise attacks and ambushes e.g. during reconnaissance patrols or while travelling in convoy. Unlike conventional smoke and obscurant systems, ROSY produces within one second an instantaneous, large-area, multispectral interruption of the line of sight that shields even moving vehicles with a dynamic, long-lasting smoke screen. ROSY’s multi-mission capability assures 360° protection from multiple attackers, including stream and wave attacks. Moreover, thanks to effective screening in the visual and infrared spectrums, including integrated IR jamming and decoying effects, ROSY effectively counters conventional weapons, weapons with optical devices and laser distance measurement.Dynamic protection –Survive on the move- - - Learn more on the Rheinmetall website: https://www.rheinmetall-defence.com- - -Imprint/Data protection: https://www.rheinmetall-defence.com/i...- - -",science and technology
